# PaperMarioBattleSystem
An open source recreation of the turn-based battle system from the first two Paper Mario games. The goal is to create a modular, flexible battle system that is easily customizable and can be added to game projects with minimal effort.

## Features
* Turn-based Battles
* Status Effects
* Action Commands
* Items
* Badges
* Battle Menus
* Move Sequences (what happens when you perform a move)

Note that visual features (smoothness of movement, UI, etc.) are not being fully developed at the moment. The current focus is implementing the core systems found in the Paper Mario games in a flexible and extensible manner.

## Getting Started
You will need MonoGame 3.5.1 and Visual Studio 2017, but earlier versions of Visual Studio should work just fine.

There are plans to upgrade to newer versions of MonoGame eventually.
