Status Effect Order (4/7/18)
----------------------------
This document lists the order Status Effects apply in across both PM games. Since not all Statuses have an effect at the start of the phase cycle, the determining factor here is when the Status Effect ends. In TTYD, you can see this occur when the character jumps up in the air (barring a few statuses), indicating they recovered from a status.

Testing is done by afflicting Status Effects with the same turn counts (via cheats or normal means) and seeing which ones end first. In TTYD, this can be done by afflicting one particular status on Mario, then afflicting another on his Partner and see which ends first. If the order seems to match up with the order of the status icons displayed, then the icons indicate which ones apply first, which will greatly speed up testing.

Preliminary Notes:
-Most negative statuses in PM are impossible to test the order for since each character can be affected by only one negative status at a time (Ex. can't inflict Sleep + Dizzy)
-PM's status order is different: they apply at the start of the character's turn rather than at the start of the phase cycle
-Injured is PM-only, and only Partners can be afflicted by it. The PM status order combined with the Partners' inability to be afflicted by any other statuses makes Injured's order unclear
-The following pairs of Status Effects share memory addresses with one other in TTYD. This means it's impossible to inflict both in the pair at the same time (Ex. Tiny and Huge):
  -Tiny and Huge
  -DEF Down and DEF Up
  -POW Down and POW Up
 -However, they're still considered separate Status Effects. Test the pairs on different characters to find their orders
-Status Effects that KO and/or force a character out of battle, such as Fright, cannot be tested since the character is either out of battle or had all of its statuses removed due to dying

Additional Notes
----------------
-The order for the start of phase effects (Ex. taking damage) look to be indicated by the order of the status icons, from bottom to top:
  -Poison's takes effect before Burn, but Poison finishes after Burn
  -FP Regen's takes effect before Burn, but FP Regen finishes after Burn
