Dialogue Bubble Control Code Notes (4/19/18)
--------------------------------------------
This document serves to provide more in-depth knowledge about the control codes for Dialogue Bubbles in TTYD.

Notes
-----
-In TTYD, any text effects are lost when going back to the previous text with Z. The text color changes to grey, and the text no longer shakes or is wavy. Non-dynamic scaled text remains the same size.
-The <dynamic %d> control code starts characters out at the designated size, which are then quickly scaled down to the text's size (defaults to 1). This can be combined with <scale %f>, which will scale the text down to the specified size. The scaling does not interfere with printing the next character. Goombella's first textbox is an example.
-<shake> and <wave> conflict in TTYD, with <shake> taking precedence regardless of the order. We may want to handle both effects at once, but that's for later.
-Text bubbles with <kanban> and <plate> look identical. I couldn't find any differences between the bubbles that use these; they look interchangeable.
-<small> uses the small dialogue bubble and doesn't change the text itself. Text in these bubbles are scaled with <scale %f>. 
-<keyxon> lets you skip through messages with the X button. This is used for Goombella's out-of-battle tattles.

-Message modifiers: <boss>, <diary>, <system>, <tec>, <plate>, <kanban>, <housou>, <small>
 -If any of these are encountered anywhere in dialogue, the bubble image changes accordingly.
