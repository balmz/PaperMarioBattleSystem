Dark Battles Information (1/10/18)
----------------------------------
Dark battles are a rarity that exists only in the first Paper Mario.

Locations:
-Big Lantern Ghost battle in Shy Guy's Toybox
-Fuzzipede battle inside the whale
-Bowser's Castle underground against Bony Beetles, Koopatrols, Magikoopas, and Dry Bones

There is only one light source for these battles, and that's Watt.
Against the Big Lantern Ghost, Watt is in the Lantern, and hitting the Lantern increases the light's radius.
You can only target the Lantern when the room is dark, but if you hit the Lantern to make the room lit enough, you can target the Big Lantern Ghost.

Behavior without a light source:

-Jump and Hammer are disabled; selecting them shows the message saying there's no one to attack
-All Star Spirit moves are disabled aside from Focus, Refresh, and Smooch. This includes Star Beam!
  -Selecting any of them shows a message saying "You can't select it now!"
-Items that target enemies, such as Fire Flowers, are disabled, but trying to select them does nothing
-Individual Partner abilities are disabled if they target enemies. If the Partner has moves that only target enemies, such as Kooper, then the entire Abilities icon is disabled
  -Selecting any of these shows a message saying "You can't select it now!"
-Mystery? omits any damaging items from its wheel
-Enemies are unaffected and can still attack with no issues (talk about fair!)
