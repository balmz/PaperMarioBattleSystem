  -Blue Toad
  -Green Toad
  -Koopa Troopa
-Neutral; very few instances of these. They don't take turns but sometimes can be attacked or used by other BattleEntities for some purpose
  -Gulpit's Rock; can be attacked by Players but aren't first in the selection (you have to move left from the leftmost enemy) and aren't targeted in multi-hit moves. Used by Gulpits to be thrown at Mario and show up ONLY in battles with Gulpits. Around 6 max.
    -Small rock (still called Gulpit's Rock); adds 3 damage to Gulpit attack
    -Large rock (still called Gulpit's Rock); adds 5 damage to Gulpit attack
  -Bobbery's Bomb Squad Bombs; thrown by Bobbery in his Bomb Squad move. They don't move and can't be targeted. They detonate a turn later and deal 3 damage to anyone in their explosion radius.
  -Koops' Shell Shield Shell; put on a player by Koops' Shell Shield move. It doesn't move and can't be targeted, but if an attack tries to hit the character it's placed on, it hits the shell instead. This holds true even if the character is obscured by a move such as Veil.
