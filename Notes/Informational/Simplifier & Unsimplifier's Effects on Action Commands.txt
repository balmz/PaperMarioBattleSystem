Simplifier & Unsimplifier's Effects on Action Commands (9/5/16)
---------------------------------------------------------------
These are the results of how Simplifier and Unsimplifier affect various action commands in TTYD.
Dodge Master from PM is also included here.

Simplifier is listed first, and Unsimplifier is listed second in descriptions. For example, "Raises/Lowers the window for execution"
means that Simplifier increases the window for execution and Unsimplifier decreases it. Dodge Master will be abbreviated with a "DM - "
in its notes.

Preliminary Notes:
------------------
-Dodge Master in PM affects only Mario, whereas Simplifier and Unsimplifier in TTYD affects both Mario and his Partners
-Special Moves are unaffected in either game

 MarioWiki currently says that it makes some of them slightly harder, so I asked for verification to confirm
