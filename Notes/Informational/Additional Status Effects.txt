Additional Status Effects (1/26/17)
-----------------------------------
By attempting to find a way to inflict the unused POWDown Status Effect with a Thunder Rage in TTYD,
I found out that several other effects are actually Status Effects.

Hold Fast - A subset of Payback. It doesn't have an icon, but it has the same battle message.
KO - Caused by Showstopper. This Status Effect instantly kills any entity afflicted with it.
Fright - A subset of KO. This Status Effect causes any entity afflicted with it to run away from battle, essentially killing it.
Gale Force - A subset of KO. This Status Effect causes any entity afflicted with it to be blown away from battle, essentially killing it.

Air Lift
--------
Though there's nothing indicating this is a Status Effect, it's best to classify this as a subset of KO.

-All KO Status Effects and subsets of KO are the highest priority Status Effects. Most do not have battle messages, but I will confirm this.

Allergic
--------
Through testing, I inflicted Immobilized and Allergic on a Goomba at the same time. What's interesting is that when Allergic was inflicted,
Immobilized wasn't inflicted despite it having a higher priority than Allergic. This indicates that either the Battle Message priorities of the
two Status Effects are different than the priorities of their actual Statuses, or that no other Status Effect can be inflicted with Allergic
at the same time.

-Another thing to check is to see if Allergic prevents KO from being inflicted.

Update (3/18/17)
----------------
Allergic prevents all of these (minus Air Lift, which can't be tested since it's in PM), confirming they are indeed Status Effects.
