Physical Attribute Findings (3/2/17)
------------------------------------
I've been testing Confused enemies in TTYD. Here's what I found:

-Spiked Goombas take damage when attacking other Spiked Goombas
-Spiky Parabuzzies take damage when attacking Pokeys
-Spiky Parabuzzies take damage when attacking Spike Tops
-Pokeys take damage when attacking Spiked Parabuzzies. This also shows that they can attack Flying enemies, at least when they're tall
