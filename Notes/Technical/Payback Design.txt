Payback Design (7/31/16)
------------------------
Recently I changed the Contact Table to take in and use PaybackHolders to determine how much damage, the type of damage, and Status Effects
a BattleEntity would be inflicted with when making contact with another BattleEntity with specific PhysicalAttributes. The goal of this is
to extend that to the Payback Status Effect and the various other sources of inflicting Payback.

Definition
----------
Payback is when one BattleEntity that makes contact with another gets returned half or all of the damage dealt, depending on the strength
of the Payback. The damage dealt back to the BattleEntity can be of any Element and the BattleEntity can be afflicted with Status Effects.

In my current implementation, any type of damage taken upon contact is considered Payback. However, sources from most PhysicalAttributes,
such as a spike on a Spiked Goomba, deal Payback damage that is constant.

Notes from The Thousand Year Door
---------------------------------
-Contact deals the total damage YOU dealt TO THEM back to you
-Double Pain and other Damage Modifiers do NOT affect the damage you receive
-Electrified, and other attributes like it, adds to the damage that you receive
-Adding more Payback from a different source makes enemies take full damage instead of half when attacking you
  -You can combine this with Electrified to make enemies take 1 more damage from their own attack than you took from it
-The sources of Payback seem to have a priority. For instance, it doesn't matter whether you use the Spite Pouch first
or Bobbery's Hold Fast first; the elemental damage dealt will be explosive from Hold Fast if both sources of Payback are active

Known Sources of Payback in The Thousand Year Door
--------------------------------------------------
-Return Postage Badge (Normal)
-Spite Pouch (Status Effect - Normal)
-Bobbery's Hold Fast (Status Effect - Explosive)
-Poison Puff's Poison Charge (Poison - inflicts Poison)
-Grodus' Counterattack (Status Effect - Normal)
-Electrified (Electric - Constant 1 damage)

Unknowns
--------
What happens when you combine Poison Puff's Poison Charge and Bobbery's Hold Fast? There's a way to do this with cheats to inflict
the Payback from Hold Fast on enemies. I'll have to test it on a Poison Puff.

Update --- I tested this and confirmed the result. Contact with the Poison Puff still inflicted Poison but also had the explosion effect
(as in, it makes Mario all black from smoke when he took damage from contact). From this we know that it deals Explosive damage, but it's unknown if Poison Puffs deal any Poison damage from this because there is nothing in the game that I know of to be either weak or resistant to Poison damage.

Implementation
--------------
There are a few things to keep in mind when implementing this:

1. Some types of Payback, such as Bobbery's Hold Fast, are considered separate Status Effects despite not showing a status icon
2. Each source of Payback should have a timer, barring Return Postage and Poison Charge (the latter gets removed when the Poison Puff uses Poison Blast)
3. Paybacks can stack, with some Elements having priority over others (Ex. Explosive > Poison). They can even stack with the Payback damage received
from attacking an entity with a PhysicalAttribute, as is the case with Electrified
4. The minimum damage a BattleEntity can take from Payback is 1

Solutions
---------
1. Create new Status Effects that derive from the base PaybackStatus, and have an option for a Status Effect to show a status icon or not
2. This ties in with solution 1. Having them be Status Effects automatically allows them to have timers.
3. Lay out the structure like this:

List<PaybackHolders> Paybacks;

When getting the total Payback on contact, go through this list and add up all the Damage and take the "highest" Element. Additionally, combine all
the Status Effects inflicted from each type of Payback. When getting contact result, check if the result is a PartialSuccess and combine
the previous result with the Payback from the PartialSuccess. Modify the total damage dealt to factor in the Damage value in addition to the
calculations done based on the type of Payback.

4. Clamp the minimum value of the total Payback damage to 1
