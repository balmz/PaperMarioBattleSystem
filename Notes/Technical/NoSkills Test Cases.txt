Case 1:
-------
Disable Jump for 2 turns

Duration = 2
TurnsPassed = 1

Disable Hammer for 1 turn

Duration should = 2 and TurnsPassed = 1

Case 2:
-------
Disable Jump for 2 turns

Duration = 2
TurnsPassed = 1

Disable Hammer for 2 turns

Duration should = 3 and TurnsPassed = 1


What's the difference here?
---------------------------
In the latter case, 1+2 = 3 which is greater than Duration, which was 2

Case 3:
-------
Disable Jump for 3 turns

Duration = 3
TurnsPassed = 2

Disable Hammer for 2 turns
Duration = 4
TurnsPassed = 2

Duration = 4
TurnsPassed = 3
Jump Re-Enabled

Disable Items for 2 turns
Duration = 5
TurnsPassed = 3

Duration = 5
TurnsPassed = 4
Hammer Re-Enabled

Disable Jump for 2 turns
Duration = 6
TurnsPassed = 4

So it's true, if ((TurnsPassed + newDuration) > Duration) then set Duration to that value

Case 4:
-------
AdditionalDuration = 3

Disable Jump for 2 turns
Duration = 2
TurnsPassed = 0

Duration = 2
TurnsPassed = 3
Jump Not Re-Enabled Yet

Disable Hammer for 2 turns
Duration = 5
TurnsPassed = 3

Duration = 5
TurnsPassed = 5
Jump Re-Enabled
Hammer Not Re-Enabled Yet

Duration = 5
TurnsPassed = 8
Hammer Re-Enabled

This also works with AdditionalDuration, so it's good to go!
