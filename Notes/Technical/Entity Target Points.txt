Entity Target Points (5/2/18)
-----------------------------
In the PM games, certain enemies, mostly bosses, have multiple target points.

For example, Kent C. Koopa initially has only one target point - himself. However, when you flip him over, you can now target his Shell (him), which has 3 Defense, or his tail, which has 0 Defense.

Another example is Hooktail: when you use Jump on Hooktail, Mario targets her nose, and when you use Hammer, Mario targets her foot.

Finally, another unique example is Grodus. Most single-hit moves can target Grodus' Scepter, and when the Scepter is attacked, Grodus' next spell will fail. Unlike the previous examples, attacks damaging the Scepter won't deal damage to Grodus himself.

The important thing to note is these all relate to a single entity. The Light Bulb on the Toy Tank may look like a different target point, but it's actually a separate BattleEntity. This document deals only with multiple target points on the same BattleEntity.

Testing
-------

-Multi-hit moves target only Gloomtail's nose
-Shade Fist cannot target Gloomtail's foot
-Art Attack can damage both target points; it's required to deal 3 damage to Gloomtail. However, hurtboxes are different from target points so this may not be relevant

-Attacking the Scepter shows the damage dealt, though no damage is dealt to Grodus
-The Scepter has the same Defense as Grodus
