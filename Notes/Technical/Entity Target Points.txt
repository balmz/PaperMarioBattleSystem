Entity Target Points (5/2/18)
-----------------------------
In the PM games, certain enemies, mostly bosses, have multiple target points.

For example, Kent C. Koopa initially has only one target point - himself. However, when you flip him over, you can now target his Shell (him), which has 3 Defense, or his tail, which has 0 Defense.

Another example is Hooktail: when you use Jump on Hooktail, Mario targets her nose, and when you use Hammer, Mario targets her foot.

Finally, another unique example is Grodus. Most single-hit moves can target Grodus' Scepter, and when the Scepter is attacked, Grodus' next spell will fail. Unlike the previous examples, attacks damaging the Scepter won't deal damage to Grodus himself.

The important thing to note is these all relate to a single entity. The Light Bulb on the Toy Tank may look like a different target point, but it's actually a separate BattleEntity. This document deals only with multiple target points on the same BattleEntity.

Overview
--------
List of PM and TTYD enemies with multiple target points; differences between target points will be noted:

PM
==
-Sky Guy; body, Balloon (name: Balloon - when Balloon is popped, turns the Sky Guy into a normal Shy Guy)
-Big Lantern Ghost; body, Lantern (name: Lantern - is a light source that's invincible and increases light radius when hit)
-Kent C. Koopa; body (6 Defense, 3 when flipped), tail (only targetable when flipped, 0 Defense)

TTYD
====
-Hooktail; nose (jump), foot (jump, hammer)
-Gloomtail; nose (jump), foot (jump, hammer)
-Bonetail; nose (jump), foot (jump, hammer)
-Cortez; head (jump), Bone Pile (name: Bone Pile - jump, hammer), Jewel (second form only; -2 Defense, jump)
-Magnus Von Grapple; body (jump), foot (jump, hammer)
-Magnus Von Grapple 2.0; body (jump), foot (jump, hammer)
-Sir Grodus; body, scepter (no damage to Grodus - causes next spell to fail)

Testing
-------
Gloomtail 
=========
-Quake Hammer can target only Gloomtail's nose
-Multi-hit moves target only Gloomtail's nose
-Shade Fist cannot target Gloomtail's foot
-Art Attack can damage both target points; it's required to deal 3 damage to Gloomtail. However, hurtboxes are different from target points, so this may not be relevant
-Tattle can target only Gloomtail's nose

Cortez
======
-Targeting rules are the mostly the same as Gloomtail's for the first two forms, regarding Cortez's head and the Bone Pile. The Bone Pile has its own name: "Bone Pile"
-The Bone Pile is top-spiky
-Kiss Thief targets the Bone Pile, but will stop at Cortez's head. When successfully performed, Ms. Mowz will quickly jump offscreen to the Bone Pile to steal the item
-All Status Effects inflicted on Cortez will show at the Bone Pile
-In his second form, the Jewel target point isn't available until Cortez opens up the bones protecting it
-Attacking the Bone Pile in Cortez's second form causes him to readjust himself each time it's hit until the Jewel is available to target
-Tornado Jump's aerial attack does not damage any of Cortez's target points (aside from the weapons, which are entirely separate entities)

Grodus
======
-Fire Drive can target both Grodus and his Scepter
-Attacking the Scepter shows the damage dealt, though no damage is dealt to Grodus
-The Scepter has the same Defense as Grodus
-If you deal 0 damage to the Scepter, it won't cause Grodus' next spell to fail
-If you damage Grodus' Scepter before he's supposed to buff himself with Dodgy and/or Payback, the spells will still fail

Sky Guy
=======
-All three balloon graphics are represented by the single Balloon
-Dealing 0 damage to the Balloon does not pop it
-The Balloon pops when it receives at least 1 damage. When that happens, the Sky Guy turns into a normal Shy Guy
-The Balloon is always after the Sky Guy in the targeting order

-Power Shock can target the Balloon. Trying to inflict Paralyzed on it always fails
-Shell Shot can target the Balloon
-Multi-hit moves, including Multibounce, cannot target the Balloon
-Air Lift cannot target the Balloon
-The Balloon cannot be Tattled

-Pebble cannot target the Balloon
-Thunder Bolt cannot target the Ballon
-Dusty Hammer cannot target the Balloon
-Shooting Star cannot target the Balloon
-Egg Missile cannot target the Balloon

-No damaging items can target the Balloon

Possible Implementation (5/6/18)
--------------------------------
We can create new BattleEntities for each target point. This would enable them to have their own unique stats and attributes. When the parts take damage, they can redirect their damage to their attached BattleEntity if necessary.

For example, the Big Lantern Ghost's Lantern might work like this:

-A new BattleEntity called Lantern
-Has its BattlePosition set right next to the Big Lantern Ghost where the Lantern graphic is (or have its own animations and follow)
-Is Invincible and is a LightSource
-When hit, increases light radius

Another example - Grodus's Scepter:

-References Grodus' BattleStats
-When hit, the damage dealt is shown, but no damage is actually dealt (by overriding HandleDamageResult())
-When hit, it tells Grodus to fail his next spell

This should work for most, if not all, target points in the PM games. The challenging aspect regards the targeting system.

To demonstrate what I mean, let's look at the dragon family - Hooktail, Gloomtail, and Bonetail:

-Ground moves like Hammer target only their feet
-Jump can target their nose and feet
-Quake Hammer targets only their nose

There's a discrepancy here. Hammer targets only Ground enemies, Quake Hammer targets Ground and Ceiling enemies, and Jump targets Ground and Airborne enemies. However, in order to target what they do for the dragon family, the following needs to hold true:

-The feet need to be Grounded
-The noses need to be Airborne
-The noses need to be Ceiling
-The feet need to be Airborne

Continue testing and see if there are any other discrepancies with target points.

Update (5/8/18)
---------------
After more testing and observations, it seems like the multiple target points themselves will be easy to implement as Helper BattleEntities. Finding consistent logic among targeting Grodus' Scepter, the dragon family's nose and feet, and Cortez's head and Bone Pile has proven to be challenging - in all honesty, I don't think the current system can support them as is. We can likely keep it as is but allow for entity-specific adjustments in some form.

I think it's best to focus on that later. For now, try implementing Sky Guys and their Balloons to confirm that the current system does indeed work for multiple target points.

Update (5/8/18)
---------------
Sky Guys are in; implementing the Balloon was painless. Next we should focus on allowing some way for BattleEntities to customize which moves they can be targeted by.
