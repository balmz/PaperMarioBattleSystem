Additional ContactTypes and Spiked Attributes (3/17/17)
-------------------------------------------------------
Right now we have None and Direct values in the ContactTypes enum. There are a couple problems with this:

1. Moves that approach but don't make contact, like Hammer and Gulp, fail against Bristles and Dark Bristles
2. There's no way to differentiate moves that make contact from the side or from the top. This is important
 because with the current system, Flurrie's Lip Lock and Ms. Mowz's Love Slap won't be able to hurt Spike Tops or Spiked Goombas

We can solve these in the following way:

1. Add an Approach ContactType. This would indicate that the move causes the entity to approach its enemy, but the entity doesn't make contact.
2. Add TopDirect and SideDirect ContactTypes. This would tell which way the move makes contact, which helps identify where it can and can't
   hurt Spiked enemies (more below).
 
To help with this, we'll also need an additional PhysicalAttribute. We need to separate Spiked into TopSpiked and SideSpiked to
differentiate how the enemy is spiked. Other PhysicalAttributes like Electrified and Fiery completely cover the entity, so they
do not need to be split.
