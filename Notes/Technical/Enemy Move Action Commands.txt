Enemy Move Action Commands (9/30/17)
------------------------------------
In PM, several enemies perform moves that require you to do an Action Command.

The moves are as follows:
Jungle Fuzzy: Kissy-Kissy (2x5 damage, restores health) - Mash A to fill the bar to stop it
Swoopula: Kissy-Kiss (2x5, restores health) - Mash A to fill the bar to stop it
Blooper Baby: Kissy-Kiss (2x5, restores health) - Mash A to fill the bar to stop it

Huff N. Puff - Wind Breath (2-7 damage) - Mash A to fill the bar and reduce the damage
Tuff Puff - Puff Squeeze (2 x INFINITY) - Mash A to fill the bar to stop it
Buzzar - Wind Blast (1-3 damage) - Mash A to fill the bar and reduce the damage

Implementation
--------------
In all of these cases, we can simply have an Action Command start when the enemy uses the move.
Similar to how Tattle is right now, there can be a bool parameter in their constructors that assigns 
an Action Command if it's true. Enemies would pass in true, and players would pass in false. 
This allows flexibility over when we want the Action Command to be available or not.

For the sequences, the moves would stop after a certain number of times or when the Action Command is successfully performed.
