Separated Entity Properties and Updated DamageMods (7/23/16)
------------------------------------------------------------
The BattleEntity class is being cluttered with many definitions and methods 
for various things. These include:

1. Weaknesses
2. Resistances
3. StatusProperties
4. MiscProperties
5. PhysAttributes
6. ContactExceptions
7. DamageMods
8. Statuses

While all of these are essential, it's best to put them in a separate BattleEntityProperties class.

public class BattleEntityProperties;

In addition to everything listed above, BattleEntityProperties will have a reference to the BattleEntity
it's on.

In the BattleEntity class, it will be this simple to create and initialize it:

public readonly BattleEntityProperties EntityProperties = null;

public BattleEntity()
{
    EntityProperties = new BattleEntityProperties(this);
}

Nothing other than BattleEntity (in its constructor) will be able to modify this reference, and other classes will be
free to use it to access or modify any information they need from there.

This will drastically clean out BattleEntity and allow it to more concisely represent an entity that takes part in Battle.

Updated DamageMods
------------------
I made a mistake in interpreting how the Ice Power Badge works. Since it's the only effect in either Paper Mario game
that deals more damage to only enemies with a specific property, I thought it simply increased damage against said enemies.

However, Lava Piranha (Round 2) in the first game has a Weakness to Ice and gets crippled and loses its Fiery properties
when hit by Ice attacks. The Ice Power Badge does this same crippling effect to Lava Piranha. That means that when the Ice
Power Badge is equipped, it applies the Ice Element only when hitting a Fiery entity. The +2 damage is a result of Lava
Piranha's +2 Weakness to Ice moves, not the Ice Power Badge itself. This means Ice Power's description itself is
misleading in a technical sense but not a literal one since all Fire enemies happen to have a +2 Weakness to Ice moves.

So, we should restructure DamageMods to be overrideable Elements applied to the BattleEntity's attack when it hits another
BattleEntity that has the appropriate PhysicalAttribute. We can structure it like this:

protected readonly Dictionary<PhysicalAttributes, Elements> ElementOverrides;

Only one Element can be allowed for each PhysicalAttribute. This is because there's no way to determine which Element
would take priority, considering Ice Power is the only case where this is used across the first two Paper Mario games.

Update (1/22/17)
----------------
Thanks to Jdaster64, we now know that equipping multiple Ice Power badges increases your damage against Fire enemies by 1 per badge equipped.

I need to figure out how to implement this to make it as flexible as possible and work well with other attacks like Ice Smash.
