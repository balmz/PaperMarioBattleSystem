Status Effect Suppression Reworking (9/11/17)
---------------------------------------------
The current implementation of suppressing Status Effects causes all statuses to both have their turn counts and effects not affect the entity.
Furthermore, the helper methods are only for suppressing Status Effects with certain alignments.

Since working on this system, I've learned that in the Paper Mario games there is, far more often than not, an exception to some rule, and many
rules are handled on a case-by-case basis, so the current approach fails both in accuracy and robustness.

I did some more testing with Stone suppressing Status Effects in PM, and I made the following observations:

"Effect Suppress" means that they don't take effect and/or lose a current lasting effect.
"Turn Suppress" means that they keep any lasting effects but their turn counts don't increment.

Some statuses are suppressed in both ways.

Effect Suppressed
-Electrified (loses icon and Mario doesn't have static electricity around him any longer)
-Poison (Color remains, but no damage each turn)

Turn Suppressed
-Electrified
-Poison
-Invisible
-Tiny


Based on how some of these statuses work when suppressed, we need the ability for any or all of the following to happen while being able to
keep the Status Effect on the BattleEntity:

-A way to turn off the status icon from displaying
-A way to turn off visual effects for the status (Ex. static electricity from Electrified)
-A way to turn off the status' effects (Ex. Poison not dealing damage)
-A way to stop the status' turn count from incrementing each phase cycle

Currently, the Stone status is the only thing I have found in both Paper Mario games that suppresses Status Effect turn counts.
Veil suppresses damage from Burn, Poison, and Frozen, but turn counts still progress.

The next focus is how to determine what happens to a status when it gets suppressed. For example, how would we tell Poison
to only suppress its effects when it's suppressed by Veil and how would we tell it to suppress both effects and turn count
when suppressed by Stone? What if Mario is inflicted with Stone already and Veil is used on him?
