Update (9/9/17)
---------------
I changed the name of this document to add status prevention as well.

Feeling Fine (TTYD)
-------------------
Feeling Fine and Feeling Fine P prevent the following Status Effects from being inflicted:

-Electrified
-Poison
-Dizzy
-Confused
-Immobilized
-Sleep
-DEFDown
-POWDown
-Tiny
-KO (from Showstopper, not anything else that KOs like Fright or Gale Force)

Feeling Fine (PM)
-----------------
Feeling Fine prevents the following Status Effects from being inflicted:
-Electrified
-Poison
-Dizzy
-Sleep


Untested Status Effects due to no enemies with moves that inflict them. Until these are tested, it's unknown if Feeling Fine prevents them:
-Immobilized
-Paralyzed
-Injured (Partners only when taking any damage)
-KO (from Up & Away)
-Lifted
-POWDown
