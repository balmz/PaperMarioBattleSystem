Curing and Preventing Status Effects (2/24/17)
----------------------------------------------
There are a few ways to cure Status Effects in the Paper Mario games.

TTYD
----
-Tasty Tonic
-Sweet Treat
-Sweet Feast

These three can cure Status Effects and cure different ones. Sweet Treat and Sweet Feast presumably cure the same Status Effects.

== Tasty Tonic ==
-Poison
-Allergic
-Defense Down
-Dizzy
-Confusion

== Sweet Treat/Feast ==
-Poison
-Slow
-Attack Down
-Defense Down
-Dizzy
-Confusion



Update (9/9/17)
---------------
I changed the name of this document to add status prevention as well.

Feeling Fine (TTYD)
-------------------
Feeling Fine and Feeling Fine P prevent the following Stauts Effects from being inflicted:

-Electrified
-Poison
-Dizzy
-Confused
-Immobilized
-Sleep
-Soft
-DEFDown
-POWDown

Feeling Fine (PM)
-----------------
Untested Status Effects due to no enemies with moves that prevent them. Until these are tested, I think it's safe to presume that Feeling Fine prevents them:
-Paralyzed
-Injured
