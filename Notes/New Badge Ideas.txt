New Badge Ideas (7/27/16)
-------------------------
With this system, we can create new Badges that the original games don't have.
This file serves as a brainstorming session for new types of Badges that I'd like to implement.

Superguard Plus
---------------
BP: 7
Description: Increases the damage of Mario's Superguards by 1.

Superguard Plus P
-----------------
BP: 7
Description: Increases the damage of your Partner's Superguards by 1.

Fire Jump
---------
BP: 3
FP Cost: 3 FP
Description: Wear this to use Fire Jump. 3 FP are required to use this attack, which lets you stomp on a foe to deal fire damage with a chance to burn.
Wearing two or more of these badges requires more FP for the move, but enemies stay burned for longer. 

Unlock P
--------
BP: 5
Description: Unlocks your Partner's hidden potential and gives them each a new move they can use in battle.

Notes: Gives Flurrie her unused thunder attack ("Drop lightning on all enemies. As a bonus, you might become electrified.")
as well as giving one new move (TBD) to every other Partner. The new moves will require FP.
Only one of these badges will exist.

SP Saver
--------
BP: 12
Description: Reduces the SP that Special Moves use by 1.

Notes: The high BP cost correlates to how good the Badge is. This Badge would actually reduce the SP Special Moves use by 100,
so the "1" in the description represents one bar/circle of Star Power.
A Special Move cannot go below the minimum 100 SP requirement.


Item Charge
-----------
BP: 6
Description: Allows Mario's Charge to increase the effectiveness of his items.

Notes: Healing items have their healing increased by the Charge amount. Damage items have their damage increased by the Charge amount,
and Status items increase their turn counts by the Charge amount. Status curing items such as Tasty Tonic act the same, unless they
also have one of the above effects.
