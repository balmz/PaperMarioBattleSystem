Note: This text dump is extracted from the North American version of the game, 
released February 5, 2001 for the Nintendo 64.

What follows is a raw presentation of all the text in the entire game--not only
dialogue but also menu text, item and enemy lists, etc. Text was extracted from
the ROM using WindHex, but because the text is encrypted, I needed to compose a
table to convert the text from its identifiers in the ROM to ASCII format. I am
also indebted to the work of Justin Aquadro, who wrote this very handy guide:

http://hocuspocus.taloncrossing.com/rii/pm1docs.txt
(Although I must correct him at one point: 0D actually refers to "-", not "_".) 

In it, you'll find a key to what the various non-ASCII control codes refer to. 
Of particular note are the codes used for the N64 controller buttons:
98 = A Button
99 = B Button
9A = L Button
9B = R Button
9C = Z Button
9D = C-Up Button
9E = C-Down Button
9F = C-Left Button
A0 = C-Right Button
A1 = START Button

Additionally, a short while after I began work on this text dump, an editor for
Paper Mario was released, called Origami 64 (as of this writing, only 
available in ver. 0.1). This software likewise proved instrumental in improving
the accuracy of this document.

A "cleaned-up" version of this text dump (i.e. properly formatted and without 
all the coding) is now available at Romhacking.net. (Just go to "Documents" and
search for "paper mario text dump," which should bring it up as one of the 
search results.)

The order in which the text in this game is stored starts with the prologue, 
followed by the epilogue, then Toad Town (including Toad Town Tunnels and the 
Playroom), Shooting Star Summit, Star Haven, the Prologue areas (Goomba Village
and Goomba Road), Chapter 1 (Koopa Village, Koopa Bros. Fortress, and Pleasant 
Path), Chapter 2 (Mt. Rugged, Dry Dry Desert, Dry Dry Outpost, and Dry Dry
Ruins), Chapter 3 (Forever Forest, Boo's Mansion, Gusty Gulch, Windy Mill, and 
Tubba Blubba's Castle), Chapter 4 (Shy Guy's Toy Box), Chapter 5 (Yoshi's 
Village, Jade Jungle, and Mt. Lavalava), Chapter 6 (Flower Fields and Cloudy 
Climb), Chapter 7 (Shiver City, Shiver Snowfield, Starborn Valley, Shiver 
Mountain, and Crystal Palace), Chapter 8 (Bowser's Castle and Princess Peach's 
Castle), Peach's events, Koopa Koot's favors, Russ T.'s messages, Toad Town 
News, Toad Town Underground News, Goombario's Tattles, Tattle log, 
miscellaneous text, selection menus, menu text and descriptions, letters, 
Merlon's messages, Merluvlee's messages, badge and item descriptions, item 
names, shop text, partner ability descriptions, enemy names, badge names, 
partner abilities, and finally Chuck Quizmo's questions and answers.

For any questions, or if there are any errors, omissions, inconsistencies, or 
other issues, please email me at therewster1106@gmail.com--be sure to include 
"Paper Mario Text Dump" or something similar in the subject line so I know it's
not spam.
