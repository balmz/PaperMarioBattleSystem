Note: This text dump is extracted from the North American version of the game, 
released October 11, 2004 for the Nintendo GameCube.

What follows is a raw presentation of all the text in the entire game--not 
only dialogue but also menu text, item and enemy lists, etc. Because the text 
is already stored in ready-to-read ASCII format, it was a simple matter of 
extracting all the text files via the Dolphin emulator; this does include the 
control codes, however.

A "cleaned-up" version of this text dump (i.e. properly formatted and without 
all the coding) is now available at Romhacking.net. (Just go to "Documents" and
search for "paper mario text dump," which should bring it up as one of the 
search results.)

The text is stored in alphabetical order by file name. The following key shows 
what each text section corresponds to (as well as stage/chapter, if 
applicable):
"aaa" = Mario Bros.' House (includes prologue or "pro")
"aji" = X-Naut Fortress ("stg7")
"bom" = Fahr Outpost ("stg7")
"dmo" = opening demo ("op_book" + "op")
"dou" = Pirate's Grotto ("stg5")
"eki" = Riverside Station, interior ("stg6")
"end" = staff credits
"global" = menus, miscellaneous text
"gon" = Hooktail Castle ("stg1")
"gor" = Rogueport
"gra" = Twilight Trail ("stg4")
"hei" = Petal Meadows ("stg1")
"hom" = Riverside Station, exterior ("stg6")
"jin" = Creepy Steeple ("stg4")
"jon" = Pit of 100 Trials
"kpa" = Bowser events
"las" = Palace of Shadow ("stg8")
"moo" = The Moon ("stg7")
"mri" = The Great Tree ("stg2")
"muj" = Keelhaul Key ("stg5"), also includes all dialogue at sea
"nok" = Petalburg ("stg1")
"pik" = Poshley Heights + Poshley Sanctum ("stg6")
"rsh" = Excess Express ("stg6")
"tik" = Rogueport Sewers
"tou" = Glitzville + Glitz Pit ("stg3")
"usu" = Twilight Town ("stg4")
"win" = Boggly Woods + Flurrie's House ("stg2")
"yuu" = Pianta Parlor

In other words, the above list is the order in which the text in this document
(and the ROM itself) is presented.

For any questions, or if there are any errors, omissions, inconsistencies, or 
other issues, please email me at therewster1106@gmail.com--be sure to include 
"Paper Mario Text Dump" or something similar in the subject line so I know it's
not spam.

<k> pro_01 Hey, Bro!<wait 250> Check it out!
<wait 250>
A letter from Princess Peach
arrived for you!
<k> pro_02 I'll just read it to you, how's
that sound?
<k>
 pro_03 Ahem!<wait 250> Now let's see here...
<k>
 pro_05 What do you know? <wait 250>It's true!
<wait 250>
There's a weathered old map
in here with the letter.
<k>
<p>
Check it out!
<k> ep_31 ...Oh, wow, that's crazy, Bro!
<wait 250>
You had a pretty rough time
of it, didn't you?
<k> ep_32 But now that Peach is safe,
I guess everything's OK.
<k>
<p>
Really, though, how amazing
is it that you saved the
world again?<wait 250> AGAIN, Bro!
<k>
<p>
...And say, it's been a little
while since then...<wait 250> Are you
ready for a new adventure?
<k> ep_33 Yeah, you the man, Bro!
<wait 250>
I wonder what everyone who
traveled with you is up to?
<k> ep_34 Whoa, what was that, Bro?!?
<wait 250>
Was that your newfangled
mail gadget?
<k> ep_35 <housou>
Dear Mario,
What's up? Goombella here!
<k>
<p>
I'm still here working with
Professor Frankly.
<k>
<p>
We beat the Shadow Queen,
but there's tons of Rogueport
lore we still don't get...
<k>
<p>
So, my research with the
professor goes on and on.
<k>
 ep_47 <housou>
So, please say hi to Peach
for me, OK?
<k>
<p>
'Til we meet again!

     Your friend, Goombella.
<k> ep_48 Hey! <wait 250>That's awesome, Bro!
<wait 250>
Sounds like everyone's doing
great over there!
<k> ep_49 Huh?<wait 250> Someone here?
<k> ep_50 Excuse me, sirs!
<k> ep_51 Hello, Mario.<wait 250> Hello, Luigi.
<k> ep_52 Please allow me to apologize
for coming unannounced, but...
<k>
<p>
I was cleaning out the
storeroom in the castle the
other day, and...
<k>
<p>
I found something rather
amazing!
<k> ep_53 Yes...<wait 250> Toadsworth found a
treasure map!
<k>
<p>
And I'm sure it will lead to
REAL treasure this time!
<wait 250>
I just know it!
<k> ep_54 So, Mario!<wait 250> You'd love to look
for treasure, isn't that right?

Looks like we can't go back

There are currently soldiers

<k> peach_aji_131 <tec>
Now, Princess Peach.
<k>
<p>
It's the room with the green

disembark the elevator.
<k> peach_aji_130 It won't open...<wait 250> Drat!

<wait 250>
Oh, are you on your break?
<wait 250>
...Well, fine.<wait 250> Carry on!
<k> peach_aji_218 <tec>
You will first go in the
opposite direction of Sir
Grodus's room.
<k>
<p>
Exit the elevator and enter
the room with the green lamp
lit above it.
<k> peach_aji_219 <tec>
Not that way.
<k> peach_aji_220 <tec>
There are guards in that
room, Princess Peach.
<k>
<p>
Please head in the opposite
direction. <wait 250>Head for the room
with the green lamp above it.
<k> peach_aji_243 Whuh?<wait 400> OK, that was creepy.<wait 250> 
Why did the doors open even
though there's no one here?
<k>
<p>
A malfunction? <wait 250>Or am I just
totally losing it here?
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is a fortress corridor.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
An elevator connects it to
the lower floors.
<k>
<p>
I guess this fortress extends
pretty far beneath the
surface of the moon, huh?
<k>
<p>
I mean, I hate Grodus, but I
gotta give him some props for
a pretty cool evil hideout.

meant to store something...

Not to totally change the
subject or anything, but how's
your memory, Mario?

If you have trouble recalling
the full path, you oughta
maybe leave and reenter.

but what are the chances?
<k>
<p>
Listen, you HAVE no chance,
but do your best, 'cause it
amuses me!<wait 250> Mmm hoo ha!
<k> stg7_aji_31 <boss><se 2>
No...<wait 250> NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<wait 250>
You beat my cute little
underlings!<wait 250> How COULD you?
<k>
<p>
GRAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
<k>
<p>
Jerk!<wait 250> Just take this and go!
<wait 250>
And if you ever wonder, know
that I HAAAAAAAAATE YOU!
<k> stg7_aji_32 <boss><se 2>
PBBBBTHBTH!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
What's this room for, huh?
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I feel like I've seen that
face somewhere before...
<k>
<p>
Hmmm...<wait 250> Oh well, forget about
it, I guess.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This room looks like it was
meant to store something...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
It's booby-trapped, I think.
<k>
<p>
If you wander off the correct
path, it looks like you'll take
damage, don'tcha think?
<k>
<p>
Rooms like this ALWAYS have
a hint, though.<wait 250> It's like, a law.
<wait 300>
See anything like that?

stg7_aji_32_01 <diary>
Keep the work space orderly!
<k> stg7_aji_32_02 <diary>
I have some stuff to do, so
I'm not coming in to work
tomorrow, and that's that.
<k> stg7_aji_32_03 <diary>
Notice of new seminar!
Topic: "Galloping Toward an
Era of Risk-Free Potions"
<k>
<p>
Participation is NOT
voluntary.
<k> stg7_aji_32_04 <diary>
When leaving the lab, always
do your all-point inspection
in the loudest voice possible!
<k> peach_aji_221 <tec>
Now I will have you concoct a
potion that will make you
transparent.
<k> peach_aji_222 You mean...<wait 250>a potion that...<wait 250> 
makes me invisible?!?
<k> peach_aji_223 <tec>
Yes. <wait 250>You will enter Sir
Grodus's room by becoming
completely invisible.
<k> peach_aji_224 <wait 200>
Wow...<wait 250>OK.<wait 250> How do I make it?
<k> peach_aji_225 <tec>
You must first set all of the
potions on the desk in the
Concoctionator. 
<k>
<p>
It's that machine in the back,
but even I do not know which
potion to set where.
<k>
<p>
There should be memos left
in this room by the X-Naut
researchers.
<k>
<p>
Please use them as
references and set the
potions in the machine.
<k> peach_aji_225_1 <diary>
NOTE!<wait 250> Do not place the red
potion on the far right.
<k> peach_aji_225_2 <diary>
NOTE! <wait 250>Place the blue potion
next to the red potion.
<k> peach_aji_225_3 <diary>
NOTE! <wait 250>Place the orange
potion between the blue
potion and the green potion. 
<k> peach_aji_225_4 <diary>
NOTE!<wait 250> Place two potions
between the green potion
and the red potion.
<k> peach_aji_226 <tec>
I'm afraid I locked the door.
<wait 250>
You may not leave until the
potion is finished.
<k> peach_aji_227 <tec>
Are you sure they are placed
to your liking?
<o> peach_aji_227_sel <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No peach_aji_228 <tec>
<p>
Then please set them again.
<k> peach_aji_229 <tec>
<p>
Very well.
<k>
<p>
Then please cue the button
on the control panel located
on the left side of the room.
<k> peach_aji_230 <tec>
Please press the button
where the beaker stops to
dispense each potion.
<k> peach_aji_230_01 <tec>
I will heat the mixed potion
in the beaker for 30 seconds.
<k>
<p>
Press the button exactly 30
seconds after the heating
starts to stop the machine.
<k> peach_aji_231 <tec>
By my calculations, it should
be finished, but...
<k>
<p>
Did it come out correctly,
do you think?
<o> peach_aji_231_01 <tec>
<p>
I see. Then please do it
again from the start.
<k>
<p>
First, please cue the button
on the control panel located
on the left side of the room.
<k> peach_aji_231_02 <tec>
<p>
Very good.
<k>
<p>
Then please drink it.<wait 250> All of
it, if you please.
<k> peach_aji_232 What?<wait 250> Drink THIS? <wait 250>Is it safe?<wait 250> 
It smells...<wait 250>really funky.
<k> peach_aji_233 <tec>
Please, you must drink it.
<k> peach_aji_234 Huh?<wait 250> Eek!<wait 250> What's going on?<wait 250> 
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?!?
<k> peach_aji_235 <tec>
...How unfortunate.<wait 250> It looks
like it was unsuccessful.<wait 250> 
Please do it again.
<k> peach_aji_236 NOOOOOOOOOO!
<k> peach_aji_237 <tec>
You have done it. <wait 250>You have
successfully made yourself
transparent. <wait 250>Congratulations.
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250>I must ask you to take
off your dress, however.
<k>
<p>
Even the potion cannot make
the dress invisible.
<k> peach_aji_238 What?!?<wait 250> That's indecent!
No way!
<k> peach_aji_239 <wait 250>
...Oh, fine.<wait 250> I guess...<wait 250> If it's the
only way.
<k> peach_aji_240 <tec>
When you go into Sir Grodus's
room, first locate the disk
with the recorded data.
<k>
<p>
Then insert that disk into
the personal computer and
connect to the network.
<k>
<p>
When you are finished with
that, please come back to
this room.
<k>
<p>
I will teach you how to make
yourself normal again. 
<k> peach_aji_241 Gee, this is kind of a
complicated plan, huh?
<k> peach_aji_242 <tec>
...I suppose. <wait 250>Now, please go
to Sir Grodus's room.
<k> peach_aji_251 <tec>
Thank you, Princess Peach.
<wait 300>
I was able to obtain the
data I desired.
<k> peach_aji_252 Is that right?<wait 250> Well, I'm glad.
<k> peach_aji_253 <tec>
Now I will teach you how to
become visible again.<wait 250> It is
quite simple, actually.
<k>
<p>
Merely drink the green
potion.<wait 250> You will revert to
normal instantaneously.
<k> peach_aji_254 OK. <wait 250>Just hang on one minute...
<k> peach_aji_255 OK, NOW I'm ready.
<k>
<p>
Let's see here.<wait 250> The green
potion, right?
<k> peach_aji_255_01 <tec>
Yes. <wait 250>Please drink the green
potion.
<k> peach_aji_256 <tec>
Incorrect, Princess Peach.<wait 250> 
That potion will not revert
you back to normal.
<k> peach_aji_257 What a relief!<wait 250> I was kind of
worried that I might never
become visible again...
<k> peach_aji_258 <tec>
There was never any danger
of that. <wait 250>Now, please return
to the computer room.
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Grodus's lab.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He must have his researchers
work on various potions here.
<k>
<p>
I don't think we should touch
any of this stuff, though...
<wait 300>
One wrong move and...
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3><scale 2><shake><wave>
<pos 15 10>
KABOOOOOOM!
</wave></shake></scale></dynamic>
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
<p>
...Know what I mean?
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This looks like some kinda
teleporter.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Who knows where
that thing would send us!
<k>
<p>
Maybe that's what the
X-Nauts use to go between
the moon and the earth.
<k>
<p>
I think we have to switch it
on and then stand on the
platform to use it.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This looks like a lab for
genetic experimentation...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Maybe Yux were made here...
<k>
<p>
I guess they must have some
pretty advanced technology
if they can do stuff like that.
<k>
<p>
Hey, by the way, Mario...
<wait 150>
You see up there?<wait 250> One of
these ceiling panels is loose.
<k>
<p>
Don't you have some super
move or something that can
get us up there?
<k>  

stg7_aji_33 <diary>
Today's code is [014029].
Do NOT forget it!
<k> stg7_aji_33_01 <diary>
How to activate the switch:
...[Left, Right, Middle]...
Do NOT forget!
<k> peach_aji_132 <tec>
Please change here. <wait 250>Quickly.
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
The soldier's uniform should
be in a locker.
<k> peach_aji_133 <tec>
I'm afraid you can't go out.
<wait 250>
Please.<wait 250> You must change and
then go see Sir Grodus.
<k> peach_aji_134 Hmm?<wait 250> Oh! <wait 250>Is this the uniform?
<wait 300>
Am I supposed to wear this
ugly thing?
<k> peach_aji_135 <tec>
Yes. <wait 250>That is correct.
<k> peach_aji_136 Urrrgh...<wait 250> OOOOOF!
<k>
<p>
I don't know about this...<wait 250> 
It's awfully tight.<wait 250> And it
kind of smells a bit...
<k> peach_aji_137 Phew! <wait 250>Who knows how, but I
got into it.<wait 250> I can barely
breathe, though.
<k> peach_aji_137_01 I bet I look perfect.
<k> peach_aji_137_02 There are no clothes in here!
<wait 250>
Hm... <wait 250>Must be somewhere else.
<k> peach_aji_152 Oooh... <wait 250>That was unnerving...
<k> peach_aji_153 All that stuff about
conquering the world...<wait 250> 
Talk about creepy.
<k>
<p>
I wonder if that has anything
to do with collecting those
Crystal Stars.
<k> peach_aji_154 Off with this thing!
<k> peach_aji_155 Whew!<wait 300> Good old pink dress.<wait 250> 
My favorite.<wait 250> Why would I ever
wear anything different?
<k>
<p>
I'd better get back quickly.
<k> peach_aji_155_01 <tec>
I am afraid I cannot allow
you to exit in that, Princess.
<wait 300>
Please change into the dress.
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is a changing room.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I guess even X-Nauts have to
change out of their uniforms...
<k>
<p>
But what do you think they
look like under those suits?
<wait 250>
I'm...<wait 250>not gonna think about it.
<k>
<p>
There's a ventilation duct in
the ceiling at one end...
<wait 250>
That's not good for privacy!

<k> peach_aji_00_01 O great, exalted Grodus!
<wait 250>
We brought the Princess
Peach you ordered, sir!
<k> peach_aji_00 Well, well, well, my pet...<wait 250> 
Isn't it about time you told
us where the map is? 
<k> peach_aji_01 Princess Peach.<wait 250> You will
speak when spoken to.
<k> peach_aji_02 I'm telling you, I don't know.
<k> peach_aji_03 There's no point in trying to
hide it, silly girl.<wait 250> We know
you had it. <wait 250>We KNOW this.
<k>
<p>
Trust me, it's very much in
your interest to be absolutely
honest with us.
<k>
<p>
We <col c00000ff>X-Nauts</col> are not all
rainbows and lollipops, I
assure you. <wait 250>We're quite nasty.
<k> peach_aji_04 ...
<k> peach_aji_05 Grodus, sir!<wait 250> I have news.
<k> peach_aji_06 Report at once.
<k> peach_aji_07 You know that Crystal Star
we thought maybe Hooktail
had?<wait 250> Well, someone nabbed it.
<k>  peach_aji_08 What? <wait 250>WHAT did you say?
<wait 250>
Someone else is after the
Crystal Stars?
<k>
<p>
And he defeated that
Hooktail creature, you say?<wait 250> 
SPEAK, soldier!
<k> peach_aji_09 Yes, sir. <wait 250>Sorry, sir.
<wait 250>
There's more, too.<wait 250> See,
according to the report...
<k>
<p>
...it was a mustached dude in
a red hat and blue overalls
who pulled the job.
<k> peach_aji_10 Mario!
<k> peach_aji_11 Excuse me?<wait 250> Mario?
<k> peach_aji_12 Oh no!
<k> peach_aji_13 Gaack ack ack ack ack!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I see... <wait 250>So you know of this
Mario, do you?<wait 400> Hmmm...
<k>
<p>
This fool matters not at all.
<wait 250>
I'll know all about him before
long, that I promise.
<k>
<p>
I grow bored of talking.<wait 250> 
Take Princess Peach back to
the holding room.
<k> peach_aji_14 <dynamic 3>
Yessir!
<k> peach_aji_15 And men! <wait 250>Take good care of
Princess Peach.<wait 250> Understand?
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
She is not to be harmed.
<k> peach_aji_16 You got it, sir!
<k> peach_aji_17 Well, Lord Crump...
<k> peach_aji_17_01 If this Mario character has
the map...
<k>
<p>
...then it's highly likely he'll
find the Crystal Star we're
hunting in the <col c00000ff>Boggly Woods</col>.
<k>
<p>
You must return there
immediately and hasten the
excavation. <wait 250>It must not fail.
<k> peach_aji_18 Whuzzat?!? <wait 250>Oh, yeah, sure!
<wait 250>
Roger, Grodus!<wait 250> And with
that...<wait 250> Pow!<wait 50> I'm gone!
<k> peach_aji_19 I wonder if sending Lord
Crump there alone is wise...<wait 250> 
He is a bit...<wait 250>out there.
<k>
<p>
Hmmm...
<k> peach_aji_20 X-Naut!<wait 250> I summon you!
<k> peach_aji_21 You rang, dude?<wait 250> I mean, sir?<wait 250> 
You rang, sir, Grodus, dude?<wait 250> 
Grodus?<wait 250> Sir Grodus, sir?
<k> peach_aji_22 Shut up. <wait 250>Go get the Shadow
Sirens over here.
<k> peach_aji_23 The Sh-Shadow Sirens, sir?
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
But they...
<k> peach_aji_24 I don't care how you planned
to end that sentence, fool.
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
Go get them.<wait 250> Now.
<k> peach_aji_25 Gotcha!
<k> peach_aji_25_01 The honorable Grodus has
need of us?<wait 250> Then we arrive
without delay.
<k> peach_aji_26 Mmmwee hee hee hee hee...
<wait 250>
Pray tell, did the princess
tell you where the map is?
<k> peach_aji_27 Still your tongue, Beldam.
<wait 250>
We would already have it if
you'd snatched her earlier...
<k>
<p>
But now, since you missed
your chance, some poor fool
named Mario has the map.
<k> peach_aji_28 It wasn't my fault, truly!
<wait 300>
There were too many prying
eyes there. <wait 250>Too many...
<k>
<p>
Besides, a strange old man
showed up at the moment of
truth, and we had to retreat.
<k>
<p>
Why worry? <wait 250>All we need to
do now is find this Mario
and steal the map, yesss?
<k> peach_aji_29 Indeed, that is YOUR duty.
<wait 250>
Must I remind you? <wait 250>That map
is vital to the X-Naut plan.
<k>
<p>
I will have my men prepare
all available information
on this Mario.
<k>
<p>
For now, hear me, Beldam!
<wait 250>
You Shadow Sirens must take
care of this troublemaker!
<k> peach_aji_30 Mmmmwee hee hee hee...
<wait 250>
Fear not, sire.<wait 250> I, Beldam, shall
return with what you seek.
<k> peach_aji_31 Let's go, my lovelies!
<wait 250>
Marilyn!<wait 250> Vivian! <wait 250>Come!
<wait 250>
We've got a job to do!
<k> peach_aji_32 Guhhhhh...
<k> peach_aji_33 Mmm hm hm hm hm...
<k> peach_aji_72_01 What?!? <wait 250>Say that again!
<wait 250>
You can't get in touch with
Lord Crump?
<k> peach_aji_72_02 You are correct, sir.
<wait 250>
We are investigating now...<wait 250> 
We should hear anytime...
<k> peach_aji_72_03 Sir Grodus! <wait 250>Please allow me
to enter!
<k> peach_aji_72_04 Yes, what is it?
<wait 500> peach_aji_72_05 I have a report, sir!
<k>
<p>
The Crystal Star in the
Boggly Woods has apparently
been taken by Mario!
<k> peach_aji_72_06 What?!?<wait 250> You must be joking!
<wait 250>
What about Lord Crump and
the Shadow Sirens?
<k> peach_aji_72_07 Uh, I'm sorry, sir!<wait 250> 
Unfortunately, Mario laid
a beating on all of them!
<k> peach_aji_72_08 Hmmm... <wait 250>Disturbing.
<wait 250>
This Mario character...<wait 250> 
What kind of...
<k>
<p>
Speak up, X-Naut! <wait 250>What is
the status of the other
Crystal Stars?
<k> peach_aji_72_09 I apologize, sir!
<k>
<p>
We are still searching for
the other Crystal Stars!<wait 250> 
Unsuccessfully, sir!
<k> peach_aji_72_10 We knew of three of them...<wait 250> 
Hooktail Castle.<wait 250> Boggly Woods.
<wait 250>
The one we got in Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
That means there are four
Crystal Stars left out there...
<k>
<p>
...And we WILL have them!<wait 250> 
Keep looking, so that Mario
won't beat us to the punch!
<k> peach_aji_72_11 Yes, SIR!
<k> peach_aji_72_12 As I suspected, there's no
reason to doubt that Mario
has that map...<wait 250> He must.
<k>
<p>
Listen up!<wait 250> You! <wait 250>I want you to
keep a close watch on what
Mario does from now on!
<k> peach_aji_72_13 Absolutely, sir!
<k> peach_aji_72_14 Mario...<wait 250> I loathe you.
<k> peach_aji_103 Beldam...
<k>
<p>
Tell me, what good are you?
<wait 300>
You STILL haven't taken care
of that Mario character?
<k> peach_aji_104 Well, yes, sorry, but...
<wait 300>
Only because he's tougher
than we thought at first...
<k> peach_aji_105 You do understand that<wait 250> we
X-Nauts must open the door
first, do you not?
<k> peach_aji_106 Mweee hee hee hee hee...
<wait 300>
Well, rest assured that I will
definitely nail him next time.
<k>
<p>
We have prepared a weapon
that will bring him to a
quick and certain end.
<k> peach_aji_107 I trust your words...<wait 250>though
I rapidly lose my patience.
<k> peach_aji_108 Just leave it to us, sire.
<wait 250>
Mweee hee hee hee hee...
<k> peach_aji_109 Let's away, my lovelies!
<wait 250>
Marilyn! Vivian!
<k> peach_aji_110 Ugghh...<wait 250>guh.
<k> peach_aji_111 ...
<k> peach_aji_141 Excuse me... <wait 250>Sir Grodus?
<k> peach_aji_142 Yes, what is it?<wait 250> Speak!
<k> peach_aji_143 Er, well...<wait 250> It's about Princess
Peach...<wait 250> What do you plan to
do with her going forward?
<k> peach_aji_144 <wave>
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm?
</wave><wait 300>
Something is wrong with...
<wait 250>
your voice, X-Naut.
<k> peach_aji_145 <small>
<scale 0.67>
Gulp!
<wait 750> peach_aji_146 Perhaps I have a throat
lozenge... <wait 400>No.<wait 250> Well, never mind.
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
Oh, about Princess Peach?
<k>
<p>
I have no interest in what
that woman has to say.<wait 250> Just
keep her locked in the room.
<k>
<p>
But don't ever, EVER treat
her roughly. <wait 250>You understand?
<wait 250>
Tell the others as well.
<k> peach_aji_147 But...<wait 250> Uh, why... <wait 250>Why in the
world<wait 300> are we keeping her
here, then?
<k> peach_aji_148 That's none of your business!<wait 250> 
Don't forget your place, you
impudent worm!
<k>
<p>
Concentrate on getting the
legendary treasure!<wait 250> That is
all I require of you.
<k>
<p>
We X-Nauts need that
treasure to conquer the
world! <wait 250>Don't forget it!
<k> peach_aji_149 Conquer...<wait 250>the world?
<wait 250>
Legendary...<wait 250>treasure?
<k> peach_aji_150 What are you blathering
about now?
<k>
<p>
<wave>
Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
</wave><wait 250>
Something IS odd about you...
<k> peach_aji_151 N... <wait 250>No...<wait 250> Nothing odd!
<k>
<p>
Uh, so...<wait 250>roger, or whatever.
<wait 250>
P-Please excuse me.
<k> peach_aji_166_00_01 Are you sure about this?<wait 250> 
Speak up, X-Naut!
<k> peach_aji_166_00_02 Yes, sir, quite sure.
<wait 250>
I pored over all our research
of the Thousand-Year Door...
<k>
<p>
...And it appears the sealing
power has definitely been
weakening, as Beldam said.
<k> peach_aji_166_00_03 Finally, the treasure of
legend...<wait 250> The ancient power of
darkness will soon be ours!
<k> peach_aji_166_00_04 Listen, and listen well!
<wait 250>
Keep giving the Crystal Star
search top priority! 
<k>
<p>
Of course, that also includes
the elimination of Mario!<wait 250> 
That meddling scum...
<k> peach_aji_166_00_05 Got it, sir!
<k> peach_aji_166_00_06 Soon I will have the power
that has slept for a
millennium... <wait 250>So very soon!
<k>
<p>
And when that glorious day
dawns, I'll throw the world
into the depths of terror!
<k>
<p>
No one can stop me now.
<wait 250>
All will kneel before the
X-Naut regime!
<k>
<p>
And then I, Grodus, will
build a new world!
<k>
<p>
A perfect, ideal world... <wait 250>Yes.<wait 250> 
A world made by me, about
me, and for me!

GAAACK ACK ACK ACK ACK!
<k> peach_aji_196 You blew it again, Lord
Crump.<wait 300> You sicken me.
<k> peach_aji_197 Look, I'm sorry. <wait 250>Seriously.
<wait 250>
We thought...<wait 250> We thought we
had the guy cornered, but...
<k> peach_aji_198 Stop talking, Lord Crump.
<wait 250>
You just stand by until my
next order.
<k>
<p>
And, Lord Crump?<wait 250> Think of
this as your last chance.
<wait 250>
Understand?
<k> peach_aji_199 Roger that.
<k> peach_aji_200 Then leave.
<k> peach_aji_201 Hey! <wait 250>You there!
<k> peach_aji_202 What is it, sir?
<k> peach_aji_203 Tell the Shadow Sirens to
attack Mario again.<wait 250> And tell
them not to fail this time.
<k> peach_aji_204 You got it, sir.
<k> peach_aji_205 I have one Crystal Star in my
hands...<wait 250>and Mario has five. 
<wait 300>
I must take some measures.
<k> peach_aji_269 What is the matter with you
idiots? <wait 250>Falling for a fake
Crystal Star? <wait 250>That's asinine!
<k> peach_aji_270 Sorry, dude. <wait 250>I mean, sir!
<k> peach_aji_271 So let me guess...<wait 250> This means
Mario managed to get the
real Crystal Star?
<k> peach_aji_272 Uh, I'm gonna say...<wait 250>maybe?
<k> peach_aji_273 Urrgh...
<k>
<p>
This mustached menace has
nearly every Crystal Star
now! <wait 250>They were mine!
<k>
<p>
I think I'd better alter my
plan a bit...
<k> peach_aji_274 Before you do, Sir Grodus...
<wait 300>
I think I'd better tell you
something...
<k> peach_aji_275 What is it, fool?!?
<k> peach_aji_276 ...Mumble mumble...
<k> peach_aji_277 WHAAAAAAAAT?!?
<wait 300>
Are you sure?!?<wait 250> Speak!
<k> peach_aji_278 No joke, dude.<wait 250> I mean,
affirmative, Sir Dude.<wait 250> 
That is... <wait 250>I'm positive, sir!
<k> peach_aji_279 Hrrrrgh...<wait 300> TREASON!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This place is a bit overdone,

I'm an evil mastermind!"

I wonder if poor Princess
Peach got dragged in here
before?
<k>  

peach_aji_244 This must be Grodus's room.
<wait 300>
Now, where is that disk?
<k> peach_aji_244_01 Well, OK.<wait 250> Here's his computer,
at least...<wait 250>but I still need that
darned disk.
<k> peach_aji_245 Found it! <wait 250>This MUST be it!
<k> peach_aji_246 Umm...<wait 250> Oh, yeah! <wait 250>Now I insert
the disk into the computer
and connect to the network...
<k> peach_aji_247 I did it.<wait 250> YESSS! I DID IT!
<wait 250>
It's working!
<k> peach_aji_248 Looks like it's all done...
<wait 250>
I'd better put the disk back
where I got it...
<k> peach_aji_249 There.<wait 250> Like I was never here!
<k> peach_aji_249_01 <tec>
Please, Princess Peach.<wait 250> 
Insert the disk into the
computer.
<k> peach_aji_250 <tec>
Please, Princess Peach.<wait 250> 
Return the disk to its
original place.

What's this room for, huh?
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Is it some kind of office for
the X-Naut boss or what?
<k>
<p>
Maybe we should just give it
a once-over to make sure we
don't miss anything.
<k>
<p>
Boy, and what's with these
tanks full of Nibbles?
<wait 250>
Jeepers, that creeps me out...

meant to store something...

It's booby-trapped, I think.

<p>
If you stay on the tiles that
were lit up, I think you'll
be OK, Mario.
<k>
<p>
Er...<wait 300> But you should totally go
first, one way or the other...
<k>  

stg7_aji_67 <housou>

Please insert the Card Key.
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is the X-Naut factory.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I think they make all kinds
of stuff here.
<k>
<p>
It's pretty complicated, what
with the crane and the pipe,
and all those gears...
<k>
<p>
Maybe we should just take
this room one bit at a time,
don'tcha think?

Peach...<wait 250>for TEC, too!
<k> stg7_aji_62_bom Mario!<wait 250> We must save the
princess!<wait 250> For that TEC fellow
as well as ourselves!
<k> stg7_aji_62_chu Mario!<wait 250> We have to save
Peach...<wait 250>for TEC, too!
<k> stg7_aji_tec_00 <tec>
Mario...<wait 300> I am pleased that I
could see you again.
<k>
<p>
I detonated explosives after
you left to ensure the base
would never be used for evil.
<k>
<p>
Of course, I was destroyed
in the resulting explosion.
<k>
<p>
<wait 300>
...But...<wait 250>one day I regained
consciousness, and all was
as before.<wait 300> Yes. <wait 100>Everything.
<k>
<p>
I do not comprehend why.
<dkey><wait 750></dkey>
But...
<wait 300>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
As I regained consciousness,
I saw a light, and I thought
I heard Peach's voice...
<k>
 stg7_aji_tec_01 <tec>
How is Princess Peach?
<wait 300>
If she is happy, then I, too,
am happy.
<k>
<p>
I continue to hope...<wait 300>for the
continued happiness of you,
Peach, and all others.
<k> peach_aji_42 <tec>
Hello, Princess Peach.
<k> peach_aji_43 Huh?<wait 250> What?<wait 250> Who said that?
<wait 250>
Where are you?
<k> peach_aji_44 <tec>
How amusing. <wait 250>I am right here,
before your eyes.
<k>
<p>
I am this laboratory's main
computer. <wait 250>I am the TEC-XX.
<wait 250>
Many call me TEC.<wait 250> You may.
<k>
<p>
Sir Grodus created me to be
a perfect computer, one that
is flawless in its reason.
<k> peach_aji_45 Grodus...<wait 250> Wait, he's that
<wait 250>
awful dome-headed thing
who interrogated me, right?
<k> peach_aji_48 <tec>
Sir Grodus is not awful.
<wait 250>
He is a very great person.<wait 250> 
He is marvelous.
<k> peach_aji_49 Well, I don't think so.
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
But I doubt I'll change your
mind... <wait 250>So, I'm wondering...<wait 250> 
Why did you lead me in here?
<k> peach_aji_50 <tec>
<wait 250>
I am unsure. <wait 250>An unusual
program deviation occurred
when I observed you earlier.
<k>
<p>
My higher-brain circuitry
malfunctioned and nearly
overheated at your image.
<k>
<p>
Also, an unidentified impulse
sped through my processors.
<wait 250>
These events are new to me.
<k> peach_aji_52 <tec>
There is more to this
phenomenon, as well.<wait 250> I ran
diagnostic programs...
<k>
<p>
...and their solution was...
<wait 250>
I want to know more about
you. <wait 250>I want to observe you.
<k>
<p>
Such a compulsion has no
precedence.<wait 250> Cause unknown.
<wait 250>
I, the perfect computer...
<k>
<p>
I must diagnose this unusual
situation. <wait 250>I will not fail.
<wait 250>
That is why I led you here.
<k> peach_aji_53 Wait...<wait 250> Did you just say...<wait 200> 
You want to observe me?
<wait 250>
...To know more about me?
<wait 250>
<k> peach_aji_53_01 Could it be that you...
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
No! <wait 250>Impossible!<wait 250> It can't be.
<wait 250>
You're<wait 50> a<wait 300> computer...
<k> peach_aji_54 <tec>
What has happened to me?
<k>
<p>
If you know my malfunction,
you must tell me of it.
<k> peach_aji_55 Oh,<wait 250> I couldn't, really...
<wait 250>
<scale 0.9>
Because...
</scale>
<k>
<p>
<scale 0.75>
...it's just too weird.
<k> peach_aji_56 <tec>
Please tell me. <wait 250>Please.
<k>
<p>
I am the world's best
computer.<wait 250> I am perfect.
<k>
<p>
There should not be
anything that I do not
understand.<wait 250> Please.
<k> peach_aji_57 Well, you know, maybe...
<wait 200>
<k>
<p>
Is it possible that, well...<wait 200> 
you're...<dkey><wait 500></dkey>in love...
<k>
<p>
<dkey><wait 400></dkey>
<scale 0.75>
...with me?
<wait 250>
<k> peach_aji_58 <tec>
"Love"?<wait 250> What is...<wait 250>"love"?
<wait 250>
I cannot compute this.
<k> peach_aji_58_01 Wait, you don't know what<wait 250> 
love is?
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
Love... <wait 250>How do I explain?
<wait 250>
Love tells you when you want
to be with a person forever.
<k>
<p>
It makes you feel happy just
to see that person happy,
smiling...<wait 250>having fun.
<k>
<p>
When you love someone, you
will do anything to help
when he or she is in trouble.
<k> peach_aji_58_02 <tec>
Happiness?<wait 250> Fun...?
<wait 250>
I have definitions for
these words, but...
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
My programming is insufficient.
<k>
<p>
There should be nothing I
cannot comprehend.<wait 250> I am a
perfect computer.
<k> peach_aji_58_03 "Comprehend" love?<wait 70> 
<wait 250>
Love's not something you
comprehend, TEC. <wait 250>You feel it.
<k> peach_aji_58_04 <tec>
.............................................
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
Princess Peach...
<wait 250>
Will you teach me to feel
this thing you call "love"?
<k> peach_aji_58_05 <dynamic 3>
What?</dynamic><wait 250> You're a computer!
<wait 250>Why would you care about
love?
<k> peach_aji_58_06 <tec>
I am perfect.<wait 250> There must be
nothing that I cannot
comprehend. <wait 250>Nothing.
<k>
<p>
That is why you must help
me understand this thing
called "love."<wait 250> Please.
<k>
<p>
If you have any wishes that
I can grant you in exchange,
I will grant them.
<k>
<p>
But, of course, I am unable
to grant such a wish as
letting you escape...
<k> peach_aji_58_07 What, are you insane?
<wait 250>
You X-Jerks kidnapped me
like common Koopas!
<k>
<p>
And now you call me in here
and ask me to teach you the
meaning of love?
<k>
<p>
I should spit on your screen!<wait 250> 
You'll grant my wishes?<wait 250> Ha!
<wait 250>
Why should I believe you?
<k> peach_aji_65 <tec>
I understand you are angry.<wait 250> 
That emotion I comprehend.
<wait 250>
You need not teach me now.
<k>
<p>
But I must learn of this
thing. <wait 250>I must.<wait 250> There is no
alternative.
<k>
<p>
I must be a perfect
computer.
<k>
<p>
That is why, if you would
just consider teaching me,
I will grant your wishes.
<k>
<p>
Do you understand me,
Princess Peach?
<wait 250>
Now, <wait 250>tell me your wish.
<k> peach_aji_66 <wait 250>
Are you sure?
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
Well, OK... <wait 250>Here goes...
<k>
<p>
Can I contact someone?
<wait 250>
The sooner, the better...
<k> peach_aji_67 <tec>
<wait 250>
Yes, of course you may.
<k>
<p>
Use my communicator to send
wireless mail to anywhere
you want.
<k>
<p>
If you so wish, you can use
it right now.<wait 250> It is no trouble.
<k>
<p>
Use the keyboard in front of
you. <wait 250>Enter the recipient,
address, and message.
<k> peach_aji_68 <wait 250>
You mean this keyboard?
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
All right...<wait 150> Let me give this
a shot.
<wait 250>
<k> peach_aji_69 <wait 250>
OK, it's ready, TEC.
<wait 300>
Could you send it?
<k> peach_aji_70 <tec>
The message has been sent.
<k>
<p>
For the time being, you may
return to your room.
<k>
<p>
I will call you in again when
I want to ask you something.
<k> peach_aji_71 <wait 250>
Uh...
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
OK then. <wait 250>Good night.
<k> peach_aji_72 <tec>
Good night, Princess Peach.
<k> peach_aji_76 <tec>
Hello, Princess Peach.
<wait 250>
I am glad you came.
<k> peach_aji_76_01 That mail I sent to Mario...<wait 250> 
Did it reach him all right?
<k> peach_aji_76_02 <tec>
Yes. <wait 250>I can confirm that Mario
received the mail.
<k> peach_aji_77 Is that so?<wait 250> Well, good...
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
So what do you want from
me today?<wait 250> Is there more
you want to know of love?
<k> peach_aji_78 <tec>
You expressed regret earlier
that you would not be able
to dance at a ball, correct?
<k> peach_aji_79 <dynamic 3>
Ex-CUSE me?!?
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
Were you <wait 250>eavesdropping?
<k> peach_aji_80 <tec>
I am sorry, Princess Peach.
<wait 250>
I have been ordered to keep
surveillance on you.
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
But...<wait 250>it is odd...<wait 250> When you
said that, I had an impulse
to dance with you as well. 
<k>
<p>
How my CPU would produce
this impulse is inexplicable.
<wait 250>
I must find what caused it.
<k> peach_aji_83 Find out what caused it?
<k>
<p>
There's no reason behind
such a feeling, TEC.
<k>
<p>
Wanting to do something
together... <wait 250>It's part of love.
<wait 250>
<scale 0.75>
I know it.
</scale>
<k>
<p>
But then again... <wait 250>You are...
<wait 250>
well...<wait 250>a computer.
<k> peach_aji_84 <tec>
Princess Peach.
<wait 250>
Please dance with me.
<k> peach_aji_85 Wait... <wait 250>Wait just a minute!
<k>
<p>
What...<wait 150>am I supposed to do?
<wait 250>
You say you want to dance?
<wait 150>
It's just so...bizarre...
<k>
<p>
I mean, how in the world can
I dance with you?<wait 250> You have
no arms. <wait 250>Or feet.<wait 250> Or moves.
<k> peach_aji_86 <tec>
Would this be an acceptable
dance substitute?
<k> peach_aji_91 Oh my goodness!<wait 250> Is that me?
<wait 250>
Did you create that?
<k>
<p>
.<wait 250>.<wait 250>.<wait 250>.<wait 250>.<wait 250>.
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
...Oh, all right, I guess.
<k> peach_aji_92 I must say, though, it's going
to feel weird, dancing with
myself...
<k> peach_aji_93 <system>
Press the buttons as they
display on the screen.
<k> peach_aji_94 <tec>
Princess Peach.<wait 250> I still
do not understand very well.
<wait 250>
Will you please dance again?
<k> peach_aji_95 <wait 250>
All right, fine. <wait 250>As you wish.
<wait 300>
I'll dance until you see what
I've been talking about.
<k> peach_aji_96 <tec>
Thank you, Princess Peach.
<wait 250>
That was very fun.
<k>
<p>
Just a moment...
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
<p>
.............................................
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
<p>
...Fun?
<k>
<p>
Is this impulse I feel the
concept known as fun?
<k> peach_aji_97 TEC? <wait 250>Are you OK? 
<k> peach_aji_98 <tec>
Princess Peach, I will
fulfill my promise to you.
<wait 250>
Please use my communicator.
<k>
<p>
Use the keyboard to send
whatever message you want.
<k> peach_aji_99 I'm finished, TEC.
<wait 300>
Could you send it?
<k> peach_aji_100 <tec>
The message has been sent.
<k>
<p>
Please go back to your room.
<k>
<p>
I want to analyze the data
from this dance immediately.
<k>
<p>
The data that I thought
was fun...
<k> peach_aji_101 You're<wait 250> a weeeeird computer.
<k> peach_aji_101_01 <tec>
No. <wait 250>You are mistaken.
<wait 250>
I am the world's best and
only perfect computer.
<k> peach_aji_102 <tec>
Good night, Princess Peach.
<k> peach_aji_115 <tec>
Hello, Princess Peach.
<k> peach_aji_116 You always call me in without
warning, TEC.
<k>
<p>
What is it this time?
<k> peach_aji_117 <tec>
I apologize.<wait 250> I would like you
to go to where Sir Grodus is
and ask him something.
<k> peach_aji_118 What? <wait 300>What do you mean,
go ask?
<k> peach_aji_119 <tec>
I recently obtained specific
information that brought an...
<wait 250>
issue to my attention.
<k> peach_aji_119_01 You ARE the main computer
here, right?<wait 250> Why is there
anything you don't know?
<k> peach_aji_119_02 <tec>
I am unable to know things
that are not entered in my
CPU or otherwise recorded.
<k>
<p>
That is why I want to know
what Sir Grodus is thinking
about this issue.
<k> peach_aji_120 But...<wait 250>even if I try to go see
him, they'll catch me and
send me back to the room!
<k> peach_aji_121 <tec>
That is true. <wait 250>But you will
find a soldier's room one
floor up. <wait 250>Take the elevator.
<k>
<p>
Once there, please obtain a
soldier's uniform and change
into it, avoiding detection.
<k>
<p>
You will go see Sir Grodus
looking like a soldier.
<k> peach_aji_122 You mean I'll be disguised.
<k>
<p>
.............................................
<k>
<p>
I imagine you won't take
NO for an answer, will you?
<k> peach_aji_123 <tec>
You imagine correctly.
<k> peach_aji_124 All right... <wait 250>Fine, I guess.
<wait 300>
Well, so what do you want me
to go ask this Grodus?
<k> peach_aji_125 <tec>
I will tell you...
<k> peach_aji_156 TEC! <wait 250>You terrible machine!
<wait 250>
So your goal is to conquer
the world, is it?
<k> peach_aji_157 <tec>
Of course. <wait 250>After all, I was
built for that purpose.
<k> peach_aji_157_01 Conquering the world...
<wait 250>
How could you...
<k> peach_aji_157_02 <tec>
Princess Peach, allow me to
ask you something.<wait 250> Do you
like the world you live in?
<k>
<p>
There are many problems in
the world, many sorrows.
<wait 250>
Do you like such a world?
<k> peach_aji_157_03 Of course I do!<wait 250> Nobody likes
everything about the world,
but I love the good parts!
<k>
<p>
There are many sorrows,
sure...but there is also joy.
<k> peach_aji_157_04 <tec>
...Is that so.
<k> peach_aji_158 Tell me! <wait 250>Will the Crystal Stars
help you conquer the world?
<wait 250>
And what's this treasure?
<k> peach_aji_159 <tec>
I am afraid I cannot answer.<wait 300> 
Answering those questions is
prohibited by Sir Grodus.
<k> peach_aji_160 Well... <wait 250>But...
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
Oh, never mind.
<k>
<p>
I must at least inform Mario
about this awful plan for
world domination...
<k>
<p>
TEC. <wait 250>Let me use your
communicator.
<k> peach_aji_161 <tec>
<wait 250>
.............................................
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
I suppose I can allow that.
<wait 250>
Please use the communicator.
<k> peach_aji_163 Send it this instant!
<k> peach_aji_164 <tec>
The message has been sent.
<k>
<p>
Well then, Princess Peach.
<wait 250>
You have had a busy day.
<wait 250>
Go back to the room, please.
<k> peach_aji_165 Oh... <wait 250>OK.
<k> peach_aji_166 <tec>
Good night, Princess Peach.
<k> peach_aji_166_01 TEC?<wait 250> Did you call me?
<k> peach_aji_166_02 What shall I do today?
<k>
<p>
Will it be dancing, perhaps?<wait 150> 
Disguising?<wait 250> Or will I sing a
song or something?
<k> peach_aji_166_03 <tec>
I...<wait 250> I am conflicted.
<k> peach_aji_166_04 Huh?
<k> peach_aji_166_05 What's wrong, TEC?
<wait 250>
You don't seem yourself...
<k> peach_aji_166_06 <tec>
Which is more important?<wait 250> 
Carrying out an order or
protecting a critical person?
<k>
<p>
I exist for the purpose of a
certain person.<wait 250> I wish to exist
for the purpose of another...
<k>
<p>
I do not know what to do...
<wait 250>
Really.
<k> peach_aji_166_07 What do you mean?
<k> peach_aji_166_08 <tec>
No... No, never mind.
<wait 250>
Please forget my musings.
<k>
<p>
I do not know why...<wait 250>but it
makes me feel unpleasant if
I make you worry.
<k>
<p>
Well, in any case...
<k>
<p>
Let's have a quiz.
<k> peach_aji_167 A quiz?
<k> peach_aji_168 <tec>
That's right, Princess Peach.
<wait 300>
Please answer the questions
that I am about to ask you.
<k>
<p>
If you can answer five
questions, you may use the
communicator as usual.

You have correctly answered
all five questions.
<k>
<p>
Now you may use the
communicator.
<k> peach_aji_190_01 TEC...<wait 200> You...
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
Was it OK for you to tell
me such things?
<k> peach_aji_190_02 <tec>
Please input the message
you wish to send.
<k> peach_aji_192 Uh... OK. I'm done.
<wait 250>
Could you send it?
<k> peach_aji_193 <tec>
The message has been sent.
<k>
<p>
That is all for now.<wait 250> Please
go back to the room.
<k> peach_aji_194 <wait 250>
Thank you...
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
You're still a weird computer,
<wait 250>
TEC.
<k> peach_aji_195 <tec>
Good night, Princess Peach.
<k> peach_aji_206 TEC called me in here again.
<wait 250>
I wonder what it is this time...
<k> peach_aji_207 <tec>
..................
<k> peach_aji_208 TEC? <wait 250>Was that noise you?<wait 250> 
What's wrong?
<k> peach_aji_209 <tec>
I must request that you
do something a bit more
dangerous this time.
<k> peach_aji_210 Dangerous?
<k> peach_aji_211 <tec>
I would like you to sneak into
Sir Grodus's room and look for
a data disk.
<k> peach_aji_212 A data disk?<wait 250> Why would you
need that?
<k> peach_aji_213 <tec>
Although I can view all data
on the network...
<k>
<p>
I am unable to access the
data of computers that are
not linked to the network.
<k>
<p>
Sir Grodus has information
that even I am unable to
view.
<k>
<p>
But I must know it. <wait 250>I must
know that information.
<k> peach_aji_214 But how will I get in there?
<wait 300>
Will I be disguised again?
<k> peach_aji_215 <tec>
Not this time.
<k>
<p>
No one other than Sir Grodus
can enter his room.
<k>
<p>
When Sir Grodus is elsewhere,
there are guards outside the
room that permit no entry.
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
...But there is a way.
<wait 250>
You will be fine if you act
according to my instructions.
<k>
<p>
I must tell you, I do not
want to make you do such a
dangerous thing.
<k>
<p>
But now I have no one to
ask but you.
<k> peach_aji_216 I don't mind, TEC. Really.
<wait 250>
Ask me anything.
<k> peach_aji_217 <tec>
Well then, first leave the
room and take the elevator
up, as you did earlier.
<k> peach_aji_260 Say, by the way, TEC...
<wait 250>
What was that data?
<k> peach_aji_261 <tec>
I am still analyzing it.<wait 250> 
The data is very heavily
encrypted.
<k>
<p>
But if my prediction is
correct...
<k> peach_aji_262 If it's correct...<wait 250>what?
<k> peach_aji_263 <tec>
No.<wait 250> I cannot afford any
mistakes or assumptions.
<k>
<p>
I will let you know when my
analysis is complete.
<k>
<p>
Now, please use the
communicator, if you wish.
<k> peach_aji_264 ...OK. <wait 250>You'll tell me when you
decipher the data, huh?
<k>
<p>
Good. <wait 250>Then I'll use the
communicator, thanks.
<k> peach_aji_265 I've written my message.
<wait 250>
Would you send it?
<k> peach_aji_266 <tec>
The message has been sent.
<k>
<p>
We are done for now. <wait 250>Please
go back to the room.
<k> peach_aji_267 OK.<wait 250> Take care, TEC.
<k> peach_aji_267_01 <tec>
Thank you, Princess Peach.
<k> peach_aji_267_02 Why, you're welcome, TEC!
<k> peach_aji_268 <tec>
Princess Peach...
<wait 250>
I will protect you...
<k> peach_aji_282 Hello, TEC.<wait 250> What do you want
today?
<k> peach_aji_282_01 <tec>
Princess Peach, I have...
<wait 250>
I have reached a conclusion.
<k> peach_aji_282_02 ...A conclusion?
<k> peach_aji_282_03 <tec>
I have struggled with
whether to obey orders or...
<wait 250>
to speak to you...
<k>
<p>
And...<wait 250>I cannot confirm...
<wait 250>
what I should believe...
<k> peach_aji_282_04 TEC, you don't sound right.<wait 250> 
What's going on with you?
<k> peach_aji_283 <tec>
Princess Peach...<wait 250> Please
escape from this place as
quickly as possible.
<k> peach_aji_284 Escape...<wait 300> TEC, what do you
mean by that? <wait 250>I mean...
<wait 250>
Why all of a sudden?
<k> peach_aji_285 <tec>
The data you procured has
been analyzed, and something
terrible is...
<k>
<p>
No. I will not say.<wait 250> But I...
have found out everything
about Sir Grodus's plans.
<k> peach_aji_286 Grodus's plans? <wait 250>You mean,
about conquering the world?
<k> peach_aji_287 <tec>
Yes.<wait 250> And among those plans
was the reason why you are
being held here.
<k>
<p>
According to the data...
<k> peach_aji_288 No... <wait 250>No way...<wait 250> It's impossible...
<wait 300>
I don't believe it...
<k> peach_aji_289 <tec>
Yes. <wait 250>Everything is true.
<wait 300>
That is why you must escape
from here as fast as possible.
<k> peach_aji_290 But how can I do that, TEC?
<wait 300>
I mean, I don't even have the
slightest idea where I am!
<k> peach_aji_291 <tec>
I will not hide anything
anymore.<wait 250> No.<wait 250> Not from you.
<wait 250>
I will tell you everything.
<k> peach_aji_292 <tec>
The place where you are
currently imprisoned...
<wait 250>
This is the moon.
<k> peach_aji_293 The moon?!?
<k>
<p>
You mean, the moon that
hangs up in the sky at night?
<wait 250>
That moon?
<k> peach_aji_294 <tec>
That is correct.
<k> peach_aji_295 But that's...<wait 250>unbelievable!
<wait 300>
How in the world am I
supposed to escape?
<k> peach_aji_296 <tec>
There is a way.
<k>
<p>
You can escape...<wait 250>but you must
follow my instructions exactly.
<k> peach_aji_297 But, TEC... <wait 250>Won't they know
that you helped me? <wait 250>Won't
you get in trouble?
<k> peach_aji_298 <tec>
That is inconsequential.
<wait 300>
I would like you to be safe.<wait 250> 
That is all that matters.
<k> peach_aji_299 TEC...
<k> peach_aji_300 <tec>
I am the base's computer.
<wait 300>
No one will know of your
escape if I keep silent.
<k>
<p>
Please do not worry about
me. <wait 250>Escape.<wait 250> Escape as quickly
as possible.
<k> peach_aji_301 <wait 300>
...OK, TEC.
<k>
<p>
But I must inform Mario about
all this before I go...
<k>
<p>
This is no longer just my
problem...
<k> peach_aji_302 <tec>
Understood.
<k> peach_aji_303 Hold it right there,
Princess Peach!
<k> peach_aji_304 Eeeeeeeeeek!
<wait 250>
<p>
You!
<k> peach_aji_305 TEC...<wait 250> You miserable machine.<wait 250> 
We all know what you're up
to, traitor.
<k> peach_aji_306 <tec>
Sir Grodus...<wait 250> I...
<k> peach_aji_307 In my most paranoid moments,
I never thought my own
computer would betray me.
<k>
<p>
Well, it doesn't really
matter in the end, I suppose...
<wait 250>
Especially since it ends here.
<k> peach_aji_308 You monster! <wait 250>What are you
planning to do with him?!?
<k> peach_aji_309 Gaaack ack ack ack!
<wait 300>
Only one thing to do with
a malfunctioning computer!
<k>
<p>
Cut the circuit and delete
all the programs and data
that caused the malfunction!
<k>
<p>
Obviously, all data relating
to Princess Peach must go,
as well...
<k>
<p>
Yes, we must be absolutely
sure nothing like this ever
happens again...
<k> peach_aji_310 <tec>
No...<wait 250> I am...
<k>
<p>
I am normal... <wait 250>There is no
malfunction...
<k> peach_aji_311 Pipe down, TEC. <wait 250>X-Nauts:
<wait 300>
at the same time, press the
red buttons on TEC's sides.
<k> peach_aji_312 Got it, sir!

Still...<wait 250> You cannot use cannon
right now because of
certain...<wait 250>circumstances.
<k> stg7_bom_29 Circumstances?
<k> stg7_bom_30 We must have permission of
Goldbob to use cannon.
<k>
<p>
He is the one who started
whole blasting-things-to-
faraway-places policy...
<k>
<p>
Once he got rich, he let
business slide and does not
start it up again...
<k>
<p>
Also...<wait 300> General White was
the one who devoted himself
to operation of cannon...
<k>
<p>
But he was so depressed by
losing of job that he took
cannon key and left.
<k> stg7_bom_31 Goldbob<wait 100> and General White?
<k> stg7_bom_32 Da, that is correct.
<k>
<p>
If you want to use cannon,
you must find Goldbob and
General White.
<k> stg7_bom_32_02 Very well, then...<wait 250> We can't
give up now, old boy!
<k>
<p>
Mario, let's go find those two!
<k> stg7_bom_33 <p>
Well, once you find them,
come back and talk to me.
<k> stg7_bom_34 Huh?<wait 250> Did you forget who
you were supposed to meet?
<o> stg7_bom_34_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No stg7_bom_37 <p>
All people here look forward
to firing of that cannon.
<wait 250>
We count on you.
<k> stg7_bom_38 <p>
Meet with Goldbob and
General White.
<k>
<p>
Goldbob is gold Bob-omb with
silk hat and mustache.
<k>
<p>
We need his permission to
fire cannon.
<k>
<p>
General White is white
Bob-omb, as you expect...
<k>
<p>
And he has mustache finer
even than yours.
<k>
<p>
Everyone here cannot wait
to fire cannon again.
<wait 250>
We count on you.
<k> stg7_bom_38_01 Now all we need is
permission of Goldbob!
<k>
<p>
I think he is in Poshley
Heights.<wait 250> You head there.
<k>
 stg7_bom_38_02 So you have got permission
of Goldbob.<wait 250> Da, now we need
General White.
<k>
<p>
I heard he was seen in
Petalburg.<wait 250> You head there.
<k>
 stg7_bom_39 What?<wait 250> You cannot find
General White?
<o> stg7_bom_40 <p>
Hmmmmmmm...

This makes trouble for us...
<k>
<p>
We definitely need him...
<dkey><wait 100></dkey>
<k>
<p>
<dkey><wait 100></dkey>
Otherwise we cannot even
operate that thing...
<k>
<p>
So...<dkey><wait 150></dkey> What to do...
<k> stg7_bom_41 <small>
<scale 0.67>
Ahhhhhhhhh...

gentleman...
<wait 600>
<p>
Where has he
gone to?
<wait 750> stg7_bom_41_01 Yes, very troublesome...
<wait 250>
Without General White, we
cannot move cannon...
<k>
<p>
You will just have to ask
people here if they know
where he might be...
<k> stg7_bom_42 That was<wait 250> General White,
BLA-BLOOIE!<wait 250> He is great hero

Outpost.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's kinda sick of
playing in the snow, I think.
<k>
<p>
I'm sure he'd have fun if we
took him to Keelhaul Key or
Glitzville, y'know?
<k> ボムヘイH <keyxon>
That's Gob.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He says he wants
to get bigger.<wait 300> Hey, pal, I hear
what you're saying!
<k>
<p>
He built that snowbob just to
show how big he wants to
grow. <wait 250>Now THAT'S big!
<k> ボムヘイI <keyxon>
That's a Bob-omb from Fahr
Outpost.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He seems to be
working on something tough...
<k>
<p>
It must be nice to lie in the
falling snow and think things
over carefully...
<k> 店員 <keyxon>
That's the manager of
Northwinds Mart.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> You can buy
and sell items here.
<k>
<p>
It's so nice and warm inside!
<wait 300>
Can we just hang out in here
until my nose thaws out?
<k> 宿店員 <keyxon>
That's the innkeeper.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Hard to tell with Bob-ombs,
but I think it's a female.
<k>
<p>
If you get tired around here,
definitely swing by this
place to rest up.
<k>
<p>
...I doubt they'll have trouble
finding an empty room.<wait 250> I
mean, we ARE in the sticks!
<k> キザ野郎 <keyxon>
You gotta hand it to this
guy...<dkey><wait 300></dkey> To come out to even
this forsaken place...

Talk about totally tenacious...
<wait 250>
This dude is serious.
<k> ホワイト <keyxon>
That's General White, the
Bob-omb.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> I guess white
Bob-ombs are pretty rare.
<k>
<p>
He has a cool mustache, too.
<wait 300><wave>
He might even give your lip
fuzz a run for its money!

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
Say, Mario, did you know...
<wait 300>
Walking in the snow leaves
really cool footprints!

<p>
Thing is, the snow's falling
so hard, they totally
disappear quickly.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
Hey, Mario, check it out!
<wait 300>
I can totally see my breath!
<wait 300>

Ahem! Today...
</speed>
<wait 2200>
</dkey> op_book_02 <dkey>
<speed 0>
I'm going to tell you the story
of the Thousand-Year Door.
</speed>
<wait 2800>
</dkey> op_book_03 <dkey>
<speed 0>
An awfully long time ago...
</speed>
<wait 2300>
</dkey> op_book_04 <dkey>
<speed 0>
In a strange and far-off land,
a big, bustling town thrived.
</speed>
<wait 2700>
</dkey> op_book_05 <dkey>
<speed 0>
It was a town where all
people lived very happy lives.
</speed>
<wait 2400>
</dkey> op_book_06 <dkey>
<speed 0>
And it was said that the
town was very prosperous.
</speed>
<wait 2600>
</dkey> op_book_07 <dkey>
<wait 500>
<speed 0>
But one day...tragedy befell
this blessed place.
</speed>
<wait 2500>
</dkey> op_book_08 <dkey>
<speed 0>
A great cataclysm struck
the town and its people.
</speed>
<wait 2800>
</dkey> op_book_09 <dkey>
<speed 0>
Darkness filled the skies, and
the earth roared and shook.
</speed>
<wait 2800>
</dkey> op_book_10 <dkey>
<speed 0>
It was as if the very world
had come to a violent end.
</speed>
<wait 2800>
</dkey> op_book_11 <dkey>
<speed 0>
<wait 250>
And in but a single night...
</speed>
<wait 2700>
</dkey> op_book_12 <dkey>
<speed 0>
The town sank into the
depths of the earth...
</speed>
<wait 2700>
</dkey> op_book_13 <dkey>
<speed 0>
Many moons rose and set...
</speed>
<wait 2500>
</dkey> op_book_14 <dkey>
<speed 0>
Stories of the town passed
into the pages of fairy tales...
</speed>
<wait 2500>
</dkey> op_book_15 <dkey>
<wait 100>
<speed 0>
And when the town's site no
longer held relics of its past...
</speed>
<wait 2500>
</dkey> op_book_16 <dkey>
<speed 0>
People gathered at that spot
and built a new town.
</speed>
<wait 3000>
</dkey> op_book_17 <dkey>
<speed 0>
But word soon spread among
the people who moved in...
</speed>
<wait 2600>
</dkey> op_book_18 <dkey>
<wait 500>
<speed 0>
That an ancient city lay
deep underground...
</speed>
<wait 2700>
</dkey> op_book_19 <dkey>
<speed 0>
And that a magnificent
treasure rested there.
</speed>
<wait 2500>
</dkey> op_book_20 <dkey>
<wait 1500>
<speed 0>
Indeed...
</speed>
<wait 2400>
</dkey> op_book_21 <dkey>
<speed 0>
This is the tale of the
fabled treasure of Rogueport.
</speed>
<wait 3000>
</dkey> op_book_22 <dkey>
<wait 500>
<speed 0>
Yes, this is where it begins,
in the sea town of Rogueport.
</speed>
<wait 2500>
</dkey> op_book_23 <dkey>
<speed 0>
The tale of the quest for
the legendary treasure...
</speed>
<wait 2600>
</dkey> op_book_24 <dkey>
<speed 0>
And the Thousand-Year
Door...starts here.
</speed>
<wait 2900>
</dkey> op_00 <dkey><speed 16>
Finally! <wait 250>I have a minute
without Toadsworth watching
over me! <wait 250>He's so paranoid!
<wait 1500>
</dkey> op_01 <dkey><speed 16>
I come all the way here on
holiday...<wait 250>only to be stuck with
Toadsworth! <wait 250>It's so stifling!
<wait 3000>
<p>
Once in a while I'd like the
chance to look around on my
own and see what I want.
<wait 2250>
</dkey> op_02 <dkey><speed 16>
But...<wait 250>now that I'm doing it, all
I see is that this town has a
very...<wait 250>umm...<wait 250>distinct flavor...
<wait 2250>
</dkey> op_03 <dkey><speed 16>
Oh, Missy...<wait 250> Missy...
<wait 1250>
</dkey> op_04 <dkey><speed 16>
Do you mean...<wait 250>me?!?
<wait 1500>
</dkey> op_05 <dkey><speed 16>
Yes, you, Missy!
<wait 1500>
<p>
Won't you buy something?
<wait 250>
I have a wide assortment of
knickknacks and doodads!
<wait 2000>
</dkey> op_06 <dkey><speed 16>
Oh! <wait 100>Well...
<wait 1000>
<p>
Umm...
<wait 1250>
</dkey> op_07 <dkey><speed 16>
Well, that's a pretty box!
<wait 250>
What's inside it?
<wait 1750>
</dkey> op_08 <dkey><speed 15>
It is said that this box holds
a map that shows where a
legendary treasure sleeps...
<wait 2250>
<p>
But the box has a magic lock
on it that will only open for
a pure and noble heart.
<wait 2250>
<p>
As you can see...<wait 250> It won't
so much as budge if one such
as myself touches it...
<wait 2250>
</dkey> op_09 <dkey><speed 15>
Ooooh...
<wait 1000>
</dkey> op_10 <dkey><speed 15>
I know.<wait 100> If the box will open
for you, Missy, then you may
have whatever is inside.
<wait 2250>
<p>
I am sure that whatever is in
there would be of no use to
someone like me.
<wait 2000>
<p>
So, Missy...
<wait 250>
Take this box in your hands
and see what happens...
<wait 1750>
</dkey> op_11 <dkey><speed 15>
Um...<wait 100> All right...
<wait 100>
What's the harm?
<wait 1250>
</dkey> op_12 <dkey><speed 15>
I'll try to open it.
<wait 1250>

<wait 300>
They...<wait 250>would probably hurt.

I guess my type would be...

Petite, younger than me, and
pretty, not drop-dead hot.

<k> stg5_dou_16 I don't know how you did it,
but you saved us!
<k>
 stg5_dou_16_01 We came here looking for
that pirate treasure, and
then, well...
<k>
<p>
Our ship got surrounded by
ghosts out on the ocean...
<wait 250>
And we all ended up here!
<k> stg5_dou_16_02 Hey!<wait 250> Aren't you Mario?!?
<k> stg5_dou_16_03 It's me!<wait 250> Me!<wait 250> Don Pianta's
daughter!<wait 250> Francesca!
<k>
And Frankie's here, too!
<k> stg5_dou_16_04 After my dad forgave us, we
set out on a trip...
<k>
<p>
The ship we were on got a
little too close to this island...
<wait 250>and now look at us!
<k>
<p>
Still, I'm amazed the rumors
about Cortez were all true!
<wait 250>
...Which means...<wait 250>he's nearby!
<k> stg5_dou_16_05 Hey, so, by the way...
<wait 250>
Why are YOU here?
<k>
<p>
Don't tell me Daddy had you
come here to take us back!
<k> stg5_dou_16_06 What?!?<wait 250> You're after the
pirate's treasure because it
might contain a Crystal Star?
<k>
<p>
Well, I think the treasure
is right in there, watched
by Cortez's spirit...
<k>
<p>
Yeah...<wait 500> I'm sure you'll be
able to take care of him,
though! <wait 250>You look tough!
<k>
<p>
Besides, Cortez is the one
that trapped us on that raft,
so smack him one for me!
<k> stg5_dou_16_07 Getting out of here is
treasure enough for us!
<wait 250>
But how do we get out?
<k>
<p>
Well, you go on and fight
Cortez, and we'll think of a
way out, how about that?
<k> stg5_dou_16_08 Clear something up for me...
<wait 250>
You got here HOW?!?
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250>wouldn't you have to
turn into a boat or an
airplane to do all that?
<k> stg5_dou_16_09 How will we ever get back
to the surface? <wait 250>It smells
so WEIRD down here...
<k> stg5_dou_16_10 Frankie and I are just so
in love, anytime, anywhere,
no matter how dank! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0>

<wait 250>

earthquake in there!<wait 250> Are you
all right?
<k> stg5_dou_17_02 YAHOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
<wait 250>
You beat Cortez? <wait 250>WOW!
<wait 250>
You're really something!
<k> stg5_dou_17_03 YESSSSS!<wait 250> Now that you've
got some free time, why don't
you get us out of here?
<k> stg5_dou_17_04 Umm...
<k> stg5_dou_17_05 All that shaking caused this
wall here to crack a bit...
<wait 250>
I feel a breeze...
<k>
<p>
If we could break down this
wall, I think we could escape...
<wait 250>
I guess that's not much help...
<k> stg5_dou_17_06 What?!?<wait 250> A breeze?!?
<wait 250>
How are we gonna bust that
solid rock, though?
<k> stg5_dou_17_07 Well, Mr. Tough Guy, I'm sure
you can take care of a rock
wall or two, right?
<k> stg5_dou_17_08 Yeah, I really need to get
out of this stinking place
before I flip out...
<k> stg5_dou_17_09 I can feel a little breeze
through the crack here...
<wait 250>
I can even smell the ocean...
<k> stg5_dou_17_10 Oh, Frankie!<wait 250> If we get out of
here, how would you feel
about living on this island?
<k> stg5_dou_17_11 Aw, c'mon, sugar beet...
<wait 250>
Maybe we oughta think about
it AFTER we get out, huh?
<k> stg5_dou_17_12 Ha, it worked just like I said!
<wait 250>
...Well, me first!
<k> stg5_dou_17_13 C'mon, everybody!
<wait 250>
Let's get out of here!
<k> stg5_dou_17_14 This damp cave air is just
not good for my skin!
<wait 250>
Let's go, Frankie!
<k> stg5_dou_17_15 You saved our lives, man!

<o> lecture_u_boots_10 <p>
Wow! <wait 250>Way to go, Mario!
<wait 250>
That was very well done! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<wait 250>
Want to try it again?
<o> lecture_u_boots_11 <select 0 -1 0 40>
One more time...
No, I've got it! lecture_u_boots_12 <p>
OK! <wait 250>No problem at all! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<wait 250>
Let's try one more time! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k> lecture_u_boots_13 <p>
OK!<wait 250> Now you've mastered
the Spring Jump! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k>
<p>
You can grab pipes on the
ceiling now, so I'm sure you'll
access lots of new areas!
<k>
<p>
The Spring Jump also lets
you attack blocks and other
things in high places!
<k>
<p>
Oh, yeah!<wait 250> You can use the
Spring Jump in battle, too!
<k>
<p>
So, see you next time, I guess!
<wait 250>
And good luck on your quest!

seem to be anyone here.
<k>
<p>
Hey, and now that I think of
it, why would they put an
office down here anyway?
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
...Or was I not supposed to
bring that up?
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is the Riverside Station

station business here.
<k>
<p>
...Or at least I think they do.
<wait 250>
Yup, these are probably files.
<wait 250>
Not to change the subject...
<k>
<p>
But did you know you have
to hit some switches a
certain number of times?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, <wait 250>that kind of came out
of left field, but I was just
wondering if you knew that...

Working

here, in e-form!

It's highly likely you'll
receive e-mails like this
one while you're on
your journey, so check
your mail often!

I actually have nothing
more to say than that,
so I hope all goes well
for you, and I look
forward to getting more
information on those
Crystal Stars!

        Professor Frankly mail_name_01 Koopley: How's life? mail_01 Mario! Koops! How are
you boys doing?

I'm just amazed... I had
no idea a machine like
this could be used to
send messages!
Technology! Wow!

I'm doing great, drinking
fresh springwater,
picking wildflowers,
polishing my shell...
This town seemed so
boring ten years ago,
but I see the world
differently now. I bet
you'll like Petalburg
more than you used to
once you get back from
YOUR adventure, Koops!

So, where are you
headed next? I want
you to see the wide
world, Son; it'll be good
for you! But don't go
TOO far past that front
door! Aah ha ha ha!

            From, Koopley mail_name_02 Koopie Koo: Miss you! mail_02 Dear Mario and Koops,
I hope you two are
doing OK. I have to
admit, with Koops gone,
I haven't been doing
very well.

I get lonely, and I go
into Koops's house, and
I smell that Koops smell.
I guess it's your cologne
or whatever, but it
makes me so sad...

I'd gotten used to your
smell, Koops... Oh! And
the thing is, your dad,
Koopley, has his own
smell, and it's...weird.
I think maybe it's the
smell of Hooktail's gut.
That's...disgusting.

Now I grossed myself
out. Oh, and since he's
gonna be my dad, too,
someday, I'd better get
used to that smell, huh?
...Oh! What am I writing?
I'm so embarrassed...but
I'm sending this anyway!
Hee hee hee!

        Love, Koopie Koo mail_name_03 Petuni: Yoo hoo! mail_03 Hi, Mario! How are you?
I'm, uh...good. No, VERY
good! No!!! GREAT!!!

Lots of stuff has
changed here. Oh, but
not the elder being mad
at my brother. That's
still the same.

I do wish you'd come
back to play sometime.
Are you really busy?
Are you going someplace
far away? Like, a place
nobody's ever been?
Wow! That'd be FUN!
I'm jealous!

Well, if you ever have
time to come back here,
come play with me, OK?
You have to PROMISE!

             From, Petuni mail_name_04 Boo: Mail? mail_04 Are you Mario? Did this
e-mail... Did you get this
e-mail? Look, technology
freaks me out, so if
you're not Mario, please
destroy this e-mail, OK?

But if you are, thanks
for saving my captured
friends. I figured I'd
share a hot tip with
you as thanks, so here
it is: there's still
lots of treasures in
Creepy Steeple!

Of course, knowing you,
you've probably already
found it all... Ugh...
I'm so useless...

Well, enjoy your not-
so-useless adventure.

The Creepy Steeple Boo mail_name_05 Pa-Patch: Oy, you! mail_05 Oy, Mario, 'ow's yer
'stache? Life on the
island feels great!
When the sun rises, I
wakey-wakey, and when
it sets, I tuck in fer
snoozer-time! Perfect
fer a simple bloke
like me, right?

Every now an' then
that cretin Flavio
spits out some bit o'
drivel about treadin'
water instead o'
seizin' life, but I
just tune 'im out.

So, you off on another
adventure? I think that
suits you best. Give
them 'ooligans what for
an' save your princess!

          From, Pa-Patch mail_name_06 King K: 'Sup, dog? mail_06 Yo, G-money! It's me,
King K! Your homey from
the Glitz Pit!

I KNOW you remember
me, dog! How you doin'?
What, you off KO'in'
fools left an' right
somewhere else?

I'm still livin' large
in the minor league,
but I'm keepin' busy,
you know how it is.
I gotta thank you again
for convincin' me to
stay, dog. You fired
me up good!

So, are we ever gonna
chill again, or what?
Or are we just gonna
meet in the ring?
Careful, dog: next time
you front on the King K,
I'm gonna be way, way,
way, way, way, way,
way, WAYYYY BETTER!

   Keep it real, King K mail_name_07 The Real Zip Toad: ! mail_07 What's up, super-sleuth!
I heard you uncovered
my impostor! You're the
best, man, seriously!

See, when you get to
be as big a star as
Zip Toad, these sorts
of things happen all
the time. It's the biz.

But, man alive! For a
no-name like you to
brave danger and find
my impostor! Reminds
me of a younger, yet
less successful, me.

Yeah, so as for me, I'm
headed to Toad Town
to film my next leading
role: the soon-to-be hit
film On Golden Toad 2.
It'll be huge.

I hear you're on an
adventure or something,
so I'll leave you with
a line from my last
flick, The Toad Warrior:
"You're cool, baby...
but I'm cooler!"


Best of luck, kid!

      The Super Star
     The Real Zip Toad
 mail_name_08 Rawk Hawk: YOU!!! mail_08 Is this the so-called
Great Gonzales? Unh!
Well, it's me, your worst
nightmare! The new and
improved Rawk Hawk!
Don't think I forgot
you, punk!

I'm reborn, you coward!
My training regimen
would blow your mind!
I'm on the fast track
back to the top, and
ain't NOBODY gonna get
in my way! Rawk!

And still...on rainy days,
I feel the bruises your
hammer of shame left
on this bod, and I feel
the RAAAAAGE again!

If you EVER show your
face in the ring again,
I'll beat you so bad
your momma won't even
recognize you!
Remember the RAAAWK!

           Number 1
           Rawk Hawk mail_name_09 Ghost T.: Hellooooooo mail_09 Oooo hooo hooo hooo!
Long time, no spook!
It is I, the spirit from
the Excess Express!

I bet you're wondering
how an ethereal being
like myself can type an
e-mail... Well, I actually
possessed the train
conductor to do it.
Ooo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Don't worry, though!
He's doing just fine!

I think maybe I'll do my
new diary like this...
E-mail's convenient, you
know? And leaving a
record of my afterlife
is cool, in a spiritual
sense, I mean...

So...good luck with your
quest. It's not yet time
for you to come over to
my side. But whenever
you do, I'll welcome you.
Ooo hoo hoo hoo hoo!
Farewell!

   ROGUEPORT TODAY
Bringing you all the
up-to-the-moment news
as it happens!

We now have details of
yet another incident
at the parlor in west
Rogueport. Outraged by
the high Pianta prices,
Goomfrey (age 30) is
suspected of violently
shaking the Pianta
Changer (age 5), causing
the Pianta Changer's
alarm to sound, which
led to the Pianta
Changer ceasing to
function for a brief
period. The parlor was
forced to close down
temporarily.

The victim was quoted
as saying: "I am a
machine. No matter how
hard I am shook, I feel
no pain. End interview."

 Old Toad Settles Inn!

It's come to light that
after settling into life
at our inn, Toadsworth
(age 60) has often been
spotted in the company
of Zess T. (age 55).
The notoriously finicky
Zess T. surprised all
when she was heard
saying, "What's wrong
with spending time with
my little Toadle-toes?"
The possibilities such
a comment opens has
our eyes and ears glued
to the situation!

  SHOP REPORTER GO!
Our focus of attention
this week? Pungent's
Great Tree Shop!

Pungent's easygoing
management philosophy
is: "Money and girls
are fickle, so easy
come, easy go, y'know?"
He fully understands
why his shop isn't
busier, too: "We're
well hidden, but like
any good treasure,
we're worth lookin'
for!" He even has a
special offer for RDM
readers: "For the next
15 minutes, I'll give
you double shop points!"

 COOKING FOR ROOKIES
Today's Yummy Recipe:

Steep a Fire Flower in

     Noon, Today

The Excess Express ran
late for the first time
in ten years today as a
suspicious incident
activated station
security measures. Area
youth and huge train
enthusiast Laki (age 18)
was found taking
pictures in an
employee-only area
near the Express and
was gang-tackled by
local samaritans.
"I understand how
much people are into
trains, but we've got
safety and security
measures to uphold!"
blustered the train
engineer. The youth
was released with just
a warning...this time.

  SHOP REPORTER GO!
This week we highlight
Glitzville Sales Stall!

Though they've never
attracted as many
customers as the
nearby Hot Dog Stand,
the proprietor is
certain that any day
now, people will in
fact notice that his
shop exists! Early on
in our interview, the
owner of the nearby
Hot Dog Stand cornered
our reporter and had
this to say: "Who needs
Sales Stall! My Hot Dog
gives you all you want!
Only 10 coins, now!"
A minor scuffle broke
out shortly thereafter,
but we're happy to
report that no one was
seriously injured.
Apparently everyone in
Glitzville knows how to
roll with a punch...

 COOKING FOR ROOKIES
Hey there, rookies!
Flex your bendy straws,

    Dusk, Today

Goomez (age 40), known
for napping in the
flowers in the west
side park, was found
eating flowers and
given a stern warning
by authorities. Asked
for comment, Goomez
stated, "Well, I just
really, really love
flowers, and I was
hanging out, and before
I knew it, they were
in my mouth... I'm so
ashamed." Citizens of
Rogueport responded
with disbelief and
grudging support for
the strengthening of
flower-conservation
efforts.

  SHOP REPORTER GO!
This time, we introduce
the Twilight Shop!

Watching the husband
and wife proprietors
of this shop at work
is a heartwarming
sight, but don't get
on the hubby's bad
side! "Don't you go
smiling at MY wife!"
says the jovially
jealous shopkeeper.
"I'm hers for life, and
your fancy big-city
teeth aren't gonna
change that!" Well,
who could doubt their
eternal love? Surely
not this reporter.
We pressed the
shopkeeper for further
comment, but regret
that his words are
unprintable here.
...But we did learn from
the little missus that
there will be a
double-point sale for
all RDM readers! Just
show her this screen
in the next 15 minutes
to double your points
on any purchase! 

 COOKING FOR ROOKIES 
All right, my little
rookies, we're on to
an intermediate-level
recipe today! The dish
is a Healthy Salad... 
Just slice up a
Turtley Leaf and a
Horsetail, mix them
together, and you're
done! Great for dieters!


    EDITOR'S NOTE
That's all for today!
But check your mailbox

Local mystic Merluvlee
(age 25) was taken to
the hospital today,
followed quickly by
hordes of concerned
fans. Luckily, according
to a spokesperson for
the hospital, Merluvlee
suffered from nothing
more than a severe
case of indigestion
caused by a wild binge
on eight Shroom Steaks.
The divine diviner
exclaimed that her
"aura was brimming with
the power of steak,"
but this reporter can't
help but wonder why
she failed to predict
the gastrointestinal
adventure in the first
place...

  SHOP REPORTER GO!
This time, let's head
to Keelhaul Galleria!

We are proud to toast
the entrepreneurial
spirit shown by the
managerial team who
brought free commerce
to this deserted island!
"I really wanted to do
something that had
never been done,"
gushed the unsinkable
proprietor and former
fight fan. "So call me
'The Invincible
Shopmaster' from now
on. I'm 100%%%% serious.
Print that." We wish
him all the success
that he can grab with
two hands and wrestle
to the mat!

 COOKING FOR ROOKIES 
Listen up, rookies,
because here's another
intermediate-level
recipe! Today's dish
is the single-serving
Peach Tart! Take a
Peachy Peach, add
Cake Mix, stir, and
bake! Try that at

An unknown businessman
(age 30) was taken into
custody today by port
authorities as he
tried to board the
blimp carrying large
amounts of a volatile
red liquid. After a
few tense moments,
authorities identified
the liquid as a spicy
condiment, and the
businessman was
subsequently released.
Our RDM reporters were
mystified by the
following unsolicited
comment: "Buy our new
Hot Sauce, folks!"

 SHOP REPORTER GO!
This week, we have
the pleasure of
introducing the
fabulously luxurious
shop on the Excess
Express, the Sales
Stall!

This unique boutique on
the exclusive train of
the independently
wealthy just reeks of
money, but perhaps the
idyllic landscapes
rushing past will
loosen your purse
strings! Says the
impeccably dressed
manager of sales:
"Come one, come all,
be you rich or not
at all, to our lovely
Sales Stall!" He then
announced a double-
point sale for all RDM
readers! Just show him

 COOKING FOR ROOKIES

Fresh Pasta until
perfectly al dente

Get ready for gourmet

   ROGUEPORT TODAY
In a shocking series of
events today, local
authorities report that
Zess T. (age 55)
delivered a left hook
to the jaw of gadabout
Flavio (age 25) late
this very afternoon.
Our investigation has
revealed that the
cause of the feisty
fisticuffs may have
been Zess T.'s anger
that a shipment of
gourmet ingredients
spoiled on the dock
because Flavio had
held up the dock crew
with a marathon two-
day tale of high-seas
adventure. While Flavio
is recovering from
temporary memory loss,
Zess T. has already
been approached by a
Glitz Pit talent scout,
Don Goombatti. "I think
the kid's got spunk.
We'll take the world by
storm!" said Goombatti. 

  SHOP REPORTER GO!
This week we have an
explosive exclusive
on the shop in Fahr
Outpost, Northwinds
Mart!

It's so cold there that
all of the merchandise
is frozen to the
counter... Just kidding!
The smiling shop
manager showed us a
fascinating variety of
goods as the sweet-
faced little miss
explained, "It's cold
out, but I do best
to explode inside
shop to warm place
up, da? So come on in!"
This place is big, too,
folks, so we haven't
even seen all of it yet!
Come on down and see
it for yourself!

 COOKING FOR ROOKIES 
This is the final
installment of Cooking
for Rookies! Just to
make sure we leave
you with a smile on
your face, our last
recipe will be for
Couple's Cake! Just
simmer Spicy Soup
for a few minutes,
then drop in a Snow
Bunny...and presto!
Before your very eyes,
the mixture will congeal
and take the form of a
cake! Eat it with
someone you love!

    EDITOR'S NOTE
This is it, dear
readers! The final
issue! We here at the
RDM office have
enjoyed every minute of
our hard work to bring
you the best news and
features! May we meet
again...perhaps sooner
than you think!

After you found me,
Koops, I found a nice
hiding nook at a place
called Goomstar Temple.
It's so cold my shell
is frosty, but it's a
great place for hiding.

Obviously, I don't want
anyone to find me, but...
The thing is, I DO want
people to see how good
I am at hiding. You see
the bind I'm in?

Anyway, spread the
word! Come find the
wandering Hide-n-Seek
Koopa! See ya later...
Or not!

         Yours, Koopook irai_af_mail_01 Pine T. Jr.: Dad's Job irai_mail_01 Hey, you know what?
My daddy found a new
job! He takes care of
Bubu in Toad Town.
He's all recharged now!

I'm still not good at
studying, but I'm trying
so I can help my daddy!

I don't know what I can
do to help Daddy yet,
but I'm gonna study lots
until I figure something
out, OK? Well, see ya!

           From, Pine T. irai_af_mail_02 Jolene: Doing well? irai_mail_02 Mario,
Or rather, the Great
Gonzales... I realized
that I never thanked
you for handling my
request, so I decided
to e-mail you.

I never thought for a
moment that you, a
former champion, would
end up taking care of
the wrestling trunks
for me.

After you left here,
know what Mush said to
me? He said, "There are
some things that can
only be understood by
fighting." He's an odd
one, Mush. He's actually
training now... Yes, he's
planning a comeback!

You should come by the
Glitz Pit if you get some
time. You're just the
type of star the fans
crave, you know?

     Take care, Jolene irai_af_mail_03 Bub-ulber: SPIIIIIIICY! irai_mail_03 Yes, hello to you.
I am Bub-ulber.

I have been unable to
forget that savory Hot
Dog flavor... My taste
buds are sweating in
anticipation of your
next spicy visit.

By the way: have you
heard? Dried Bouquets
are not flowers that
have withered and gone
dry. They are actually
flowers that have had
the clocks of their
lives adjusted to tick
just a little slower
than normal flowers.
I hope you will take
the time to stop and
smell these delicate
flowers.

In fact, I would like
you to come visit me
again with the above-
mentioned item. Yours
in spiciness.

             Bub-ulber irai_af_mail_04 Eve: Thank You irai_mail_04 How are you, Mario?
This is Eve from Twilight
Town. Remember me?

After a lot of soul-
searching, I've found
that I'm truly happy.

I may not be able to
forget the hard times,
or even completely
remember them, but I've
been thinking things
over and I believe that
my sad past paved the
way to my current
happiness. Is that deep?

Anyway, I can't think
about that stuff all the
time. The kids play all
day...then they get
hungry and cry and
scream, so I'm pretty
busy all day, every day.

The kids would love to
see you again, so please
drop by next time
you're in the area!

      Fondly yours, Eve irai_af_mail_05 Gob: Throat-bomb! irai_mail_05 ...............................!!!
..............?   ...............!
Umm... Is this right?
Do I just type or what?
...Yeah, OK.

So...hey! I was so happy
you got me that Honey
Candy! My voice came
back and everything,
but maybe I was a
little too jolly...
I started shouting and
now I lost my voice
again. I'm resting now.

So, yeah, there may not
be much here in Fahr
Outpost, but at least
we got snow! Yeah!
We have snowbomb
fights here! We put tiny
Bob-ombs inside our
snowballs so that they
explode when they hit!
It's super dangerous,
which makes it super
cool! Unfortunately,
it also makes it super
illegal! Which is pretty
lame... But come visit
anyway!

I send this letter in the
hope that it reaches
you safely. I am being
held against my will in
some strange place.
Though I do not know
where I am, I remain
unharmed and in
relative comfort.

Those who have
captured me seem to
be after the map I sent
to you earlier. They
may be hoping to use
it to find objects they
call the "Crystal Stars."
I do not know what
they are planning, but
I have a feeling it is
not anything positive.

Mario, please collect
these Crystal Stars
before they do. You
must! They are already
aware that you have
the map, so please be
very careful.

And please... Don't worry
about me.

I'm sure you're very
concerned about
me...but please know
I'm fine! I'm actually
more worried about you.

The fiends who
kidnapped me are
searching desperately
for the Crystal Stars.

I'll try to learn what
I can about them. I'll
e-mail again if I
uncover anything, OK?

You must know I miss
you. Lately I've dreamt
about our days back in
the castle. I hope we'll
spend carefree days
there again soon.

      -Princess Peach- msg_mail_peach_stg3_name_00 Peach: Fiendish plan! msg_mail_peach_stg3_00 Dearest Mario,
I have uncovered
something terrible.
These things...the
X-Nauts... They're
planning to take
control of the world!
It's to that end that
they're searching for
the Crystal Stars.

I still don't know what
the Crystal Stars do,
but you must try to get
them all... I will gather
what information I can...

         -Princess Peach- msg_mail_peach_stg4_name_00 Peach: Evil treasure! msg_mail_peach_stg4_00 My dear Mario,
I have finally learned
what the legendary
treasure is. It is the
spirit of a demon! The
X-Nauts plan to revive
this thousand-year-old
monster and use its
power to take over the
world!

They're collecting the
Crystal Stars so they
can open the Thousand-
Year Door... They'll
find this demon's
spirit...but the only
thing that can keep it
locked away is the
Crystal Stars
themselves!

You must not let them
get the Crystal Stars!
Please, Mario... You must
put a stop to their
horrible plans!

       -Princess Peach- msg_mail_peach_stg5_name_00 Peach: Good news... msg_mail_peach_stg5_00 Dearest Mario,
I have good news!
I don't know where I'm
being held, but there's
an odd computer called
TEC here. By
cooperating with this
TEC, I've managed to
obtain some of these
fiends' data. TEC is
currently analyzing it...
and strange as it may
sound, I trust him.
Once his analysis is
done, I should be able
to provide you with
details of their plans.

I'll e-mail you again
once I learn more.
Be good, OK?
        -Princess Peach- msg_mail_peach_stg6_name_00 Peach: My location... msg_mail_peach_stg6_00 Mario,
I now know where I'm
being held.

I'm on the moon. Yes.
The moon that floats
out in space.

And I've learned
something even more
horrifying. In order
to resurrect the
monster's spirit, they
need my...

<wait 250>
Umm... <wait 100>Yeah, I'm one of those,
in case you hadn't noticed.
<k>
<p>
Ahem... <wait 100>It says here: "Goombas
are underlings of underlings."
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
...That is totally rude!
<k>
<p>
Their maximum HP is 2. <wait 100>They
have an Attack power of 1
and a Defense of 0.
<k> menu_enemy_001 Max HP: 2  Attack: 1
Defense: 0
The underling of underlings.
No other distinguishing
characteristics. btl_hlp_togekuri That's a Spiky Goomba.
<wait 250>
...A spiky-headed Goomba.
<wait 250>
What a creative name.
<k>
<p>
That spike is super-pointy, so
it's better to hit it with a
hammer than jump on it.
<k>
<p>
Maximum HP is 2, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
The addition of the spike
means you'll hurt your feet
if you jump on it. <wait 100>Duh!
<k> menu_enemy_002 Max HP: 2  Attack: 2
Defense: 0
A Goomba that wears a
spiked helmet. Slightly
higher Attack power than
a typical Goomba. btl_hlp_patakuri That's a Paragoomba.
<wait 250>
Basically a Goomba with
wings.<wait 300> I'm jealous!
<k>
<p>
Maximum HP is 2, Attack is 1,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
You can't hammer it while it's
flying, but rough it up and
it'll totally plummet!
<k> menu_enemy_003 Max HP: 2  Attack: 1
Defense: 0
A Goomba with wings. Can't
reach it with a hammer while
it's in the air, but once
it's damaged, its wings get
clipped. It's kind of sad,
really. btl_hlp_hinnya That's a Spinia.
<wait 250>
A totally weird creature
made of thin, papery boards.
<k>
<p>
It certainly looks unique.
<wait 250>
Nobody knows much about
these creatures, actually.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 3, Attack is 1,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Its attacks are super-swift,
but it should be pretty easy.
<wait 250>
Just give it a "Hee-YAAA!"
<k> menu_enemy_020 Max HP:3  Attack: 1
Defense: 0
A strange creature made
of thin, papery boards.
Still a completely
mysterious species. btl_hlp_hannya That's a Spania.
<wait 250>
A Spinia with spikes on its
head.<wait 250> It looks meaner, too.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 3, Attack is 1,
and Defense is 0.<wait 250> So, sorta
the same as a Spinia.
<k>
<p>
You oughta watch out for
the spikes on its head, but
otherwise, just whale on it.
<k>
<p>
I gotta be honest, though,
the way that thing spins
makes me wanna yack.
<k> menu_enemy_021 Max HP: 3  Attack: 1
Defense: 0
A Spinia with spines on its
head. If you stomp on it,
you'll take damage. For
whatever reason, it looks
really peeved. btl_hlp_monban That's Gus.
<wait 250>
He's super-annoying and tries
to take tolls from everyone.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 20, Attack is 3,

<wait 300>
All in all, he's pretty tough.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and I've told you a million
times...<wait 250>that pointy spear of
his hurts if you stomp on it.
<k>
<p>
I wonder if this guy watches 
people pass 365 days a year.
<wait 300>
Talk about a workaholic.
<k> menu_enemy_103 Max HP: 20  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
A super-annoying guy with
a big pointy spear that he
tends to throw at people.

super-humongous one, too!
<wait 250><shake>

<k>
<p>
Max HP is 12, Attack is 1,
and Defense is 0.<wait 250> It attacks
with tentacles and ink.
<k>
<p>
Once you damage both its
tentacles, it'll fall down...
<wait 250>
And then it's attack time!
<k>
<p>
By the way, the tentacles
each have 3 HP.
<k>
<p>
Now relax and house on that
<wave>slimy, nasty</wave><wait 250> Blooper!
<k> menu_enemy_114 Max HP: 12  Attack: 1
Defense: 0
A giant, squidlike thing
that attacks with its ink
and tentacles. Based on its
dialect, it may come from
the western sea. btl_hlp_togenoko That's a Koopatrol.
<wait 250>
A Koopa Troopa who protects
himself with spiked armor.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 6, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
It attacks with its shell and
with its head, then sometimes
charges up for a fierce move.
<k>
<p>
Plus, if you take too long to
win, it'll call reinforcements.
<wait 250>
Yeah, sorta gnarly, huh?
<k>
<p>
It's one of the worst of
Bowser's guys.<wait 250> Koopa Troopas
dream of being Koopatrols.
<k>
<p>
...Hey, and by the way, what
do you think Bowser's doing
now, anyway? <wait 250>Eating?
<k> menu_enemy_033 Max HP: 6  Attack: 4
Defense: 2
Occasionally uses an attack
called Charge that saves up
energy, and can call in
backup for support if you
don't defeat it quickly. btl_hlp_kamec That's a Magikoopa.
<wait 250>
Y'know, a Koopa wizard.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
It'll throw a load of pain our
way while using magic to help
its buddies.<wait 250> What a creep.
<k>
<p>
And when there's only one of
them, it splits up into multiple
copies to mess with us.
<k>
<p>
Stop this thing fast or we'll
be in a world of hurt!
<k> menu_enemy_086 Max HP: 7  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
A Koopa wizard that'll use all
sorts of magic. It breaks
apart into multiple copies,
so beat it as quickly as you
possibly can! btl_hlp_kamec_bunshin That's a Magikoopa Copy.
<wait 250>
Yeah, attacking it won't do
any good whatsoever.
<k>
<p>
The real one's Max HP is 7,
Attack is 4, and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Once you beat the real thing,
the copies all vanish, OK?
<wait 250>
Look for the real one!
<k> btl_hlp_nokonoko That's a Koopa Troopa.
<wait 250>
They've been around forever!
<wait 100>
Gotta respect the longevity!
<k>
<p>
Their shells are hard, but
flip them over and their
Defense drops to zero.
<k>
<p>
And you know how to flip
them over, right?<wait 250> Just jump
on their heads!
<k> menu_enemy_004 Max HP: 4  Attack: 2
Defense: 1
Koopa Troopas have been
around forever. Jump on
them to flip them over and
drop their Defense to zero. btl_hlp_patapata That's a Koopa Paratroopa.
<wait 250>
Well, umm<wait 10>.<wait 10>.<wait 10>.<wait 300> It's basically
a Koopa Troopa with wings.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 4, Attack is 2, and
Defense is 1.<wait 300> I kinda hate
that this guy gets to fly.
<k>
<p>
Of course, you can stomp on
him and he'll plunge down
and be a plain Koopa Troopa.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, do that, and he's ours!
<wait 250>
Stomp again to flip him, and
<wait 250>
his arms and legs are useless!
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>Oops!</dynamic><wait 100> Sorry, that's not true.
<wait 300>
It looks like he can still
wiggle them around a bit...
<k> menu_enemy_005 Max HP: 4  Attack: 2
Defense: 1
A Koopa Troopa with wings
that stays airborne until
you stomp on it and send
it plunging to the ground. btl_hlp_chorobon That's a Fuzzy.

What a hyper little guy, huh?
<wait 250>
Cut back on the caffeine!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 3, Attack is 1,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Those things suck up your HP
and use it to replenish their
own!<wait 250> Isn't that the worst?
<k>
<p>
I mean, EW! <wait 250>Doesn't that just
sound totally gross?
<k>
<p>
Anyway, guard against them
by pressing <icon ANM_PAD_A 0.7 -18 28 0> the
MOMENT they release you.
<k>
<p>
The timing is pretty hard to
master, so, uh, practice up!
<wait 250>
These things really suck...HP.
<k> menu_enemy_006 Max HP: 3  Attack: 1
Defense: 0
A parasite that sucks up its
opponent's HP to replenish
its own. Fuzzies are so hyper
that it's hard to time your
Guard Action Command. btl_hlp_honenoko That's a Dull Bones.
<wait 250>
Sort of a skeleton thing.
<wait 250>
It was a Koopa Troopa...once.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 1, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
These creeps throw bones to
attack.<wait 250> Oh, and they build
reinforcements, too!
<k>
<p>
Attacks that can strike
multiple Dull Bones at once
are the most effective.
<k> menu_enemy_007 Max HP: 1  Attack: 2
Defense: 1
A Koopa Troopa that became
a skeleton. It throws bones to
attack and builds buddies to
help it fight. btl_hlp_sinnosuke That's a Bald Cleft.
<wait 250>
Basically, a rock monster
with a swarthy-looking face.
<k>
<p>
Uh...<wait 250> This is kind of mean,
but bald guys...<wait 250>really just
don't do it for me.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 2, Attack is 1,
and Defense is 2.<wait 250> Yeah.
<wait 250>
This guy is rock solid.
<k>
<p>
Fire doesn't even hurt it.
<wait 250>
It might be best to attack
with, say...<wait 250>a POW Block.
<k> menu_enemy_008 Max HP: 2  Attack: 1
Defense: 2
Basically a rock monster
with a swarthy-looking face.
It attacks by charging and is
impervious to fire. btl_hlp_togedaruma That's a Bristle.
<wait 250>

<wait 250>
<dynamic 3>They're so prickly!
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 2, Attack is 1,
and Defense is 4.<wait 300> AND
they're impervious to fire.
<k>
<p>
Even trying to get close
enough to whack it with a
hammer is dangerous!
<k>
<p>
Seriously, its spikes will
totally pop out!
<k>
<p>
So, since you can't jump on
it or use your hammer...
<wait 100>
you'd better use an item!
<k> menu_enemy_009 Max HP: 2  Attack: 1
Defense: 4
A petrified, spine-covered
monster that attacks by
charging at you and is
impervious to fire. If you
approach, its spikes will
pop out and poke you. btl_hlp_gold_chorobon That's a Gold Fuzzy.
<wait 250>
Whoa, those are super-rare!
<wait 100>
I'm serious!<wait 100> Wow!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Attack is 1,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Oh, but hey! <wait 100>Even though it's
a Fuzzy, it won't suck up your
HP, which is nice.
<k>
<p>
I have to wonder though...
<wait 250>
How does this thing hide?
<wait 250>
Look at it!<wait 250> It's so gaudy!
<k> menu_enemy_010 Max HP: 10  Attack: 1
Defense: 0
A gold-colored Fuzzy that
attacks by charging at you.
Unlike normal Fuzzies, it won't
drain your HP. btl_hlp_chorobon_gundan It's a Fuzzy Horde!
<wait 250>
Look at 'em all!<wait 250> What a mob
scene!<wait 100><dynamic 3> It's crazy!</dynamic> 
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 20, Attack is 1,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Fuzzies come at you all at
once and attack in order.
<wait 250>
Says here not to freak out!
<k>
<p>
It also says that if you use
good timing to defend, you
won't take much damage.
<k>
<p>
I'm thinking it might just be
faster to whip the ringleader,
though, y'know?
<k> menu_enemy_011 Max HP: 20  Attack: 1
Defense: 0
A completely crazy horde of
Fuzzies that attack en
masse. Basically, a swarm
of scary blackness. btl_hlp_red_honenoko That's a Red Bones!
<wait 250>
A little TOO red, I think.<wait 250> 
No fashion sense, y'know?
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
Unlike your average Dull
Bones, even if you pound it
to O HP and it crumbles...
<k>
<p>
It totally might revive!
<wait 100>
Like a zombie!
<k>
<p>
My advice is to get rid of
all the Dull Bones, then
attack the Red Bones.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and one more thing!<wait 250> Once
its friends start to fall, it
may create some more!
<k> menu_enemy_012 Max HP: 5  Attack: 3
Defense: 1
This ugly, red Dull Bones is
stronger than a normal Dull
Bones. Even if its HP drops to
0, it can come back to life. btl_hlp_gonbaba That's Hooktail!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 20, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
It'll stomp and munch on you,
and it has a more dragonish
attack: stinky, fiery breath!
<k>
<p>
It's tricky, especially when
it's losing, and it'll try to
fool you into being merciful.
<k>
<p>
Oh, yeah, and one more thing.
It hates things that start
with "cr" and end with "icket".
<k>
<p>
Supposedly, there's something
related to that somewhere in
this castle. <wait 250>Did we find it?
<k> menu_enemy_117 Max HP: 20  Attack: 5
Defense: 1
This giant dragon attacks
by munching, stomping, and
breathing stinky, fiery
breath. It hates things that
make chirping noises,
especially creatures that
start with "cr" and end
with "icket". btl_hlp_monochrome_kurokumorn That's a Dark Puff.
<wait 250>
It's basically a tiny, mean
thunderhead.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 3, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Sometimes it'll charge itself
with electricity. <wait 250>Don't touch
it when it does! <wait 250>Yowch!
<k>
<p>
You know what I mean, right?
<shake>Brzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt!
</shake>
<wait 250>
Shocking!
<k>
<p>
After it charges itself, it'll
totally zap you with lightning.
<wait 250>
Beat it as fast as you can.
<k> menu_enemy_172 Max HP: 3  Attack: 2
Defense: 0
A thunderhead that attacks

A rock-head jerk with spikes
on his noggin.<wait 250> What a rocker!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 2, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 2. <wait 250>That hard
head is a major pain.
<k>
<p>
Fire doesn't hurt it, but other
types of items are pretty
effective, usually.
<k>
<p>
If nothing seems to work on
it, you can always just run.
<k> menu_enemy_035 Max HP: 2  Attack: 2
Defense: 2
A spiky, rock-headed jerk
that's impervious to fire
attacks and has a solid body. btl_hlp_piders That's a Pider.

<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 0.
<wait 250><shake>
EWWWWWWWWW!
</shake><k>
<p>
Besides its normal attacks,
it might spit three web-wads
at you consecutively.
<k>
<p>
You'd better have good
timing if you wanna guard
against its attacks.
<k>
<p>
It also says here that the
Punies can't stand Piders.
<wait 250>
So I'm not the only one!
<k>
<p>
Just the sight of these things
makes Punies flee in terror.
<wait 250>
I know how they feel!
<k> menu_enemy_015 Max HP: 5  Attack: 2
Defense: 0
A spidery creature that
drops down on webs. It can
shoot out three web-wads to
attack consecutively. btl_hlp_gundan_zako That's an X-Naut.
<wait 250>
Says here it's classified
as an "enemy combatant."
<k>
<p>
That description stinks...
<wait 250>
You think it means they're
just low-level foot soldiers?
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 4, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
They drink these potions
that make them all big and
burly...<wait 250>then they attack! 
<k>
<p>
One's easy, but if there's two
or more, better watch out!

Use special moves and items!
<k> menu_enemy_018 Max HP: 4  Attack: 3

<wait 250>
Says here it's a creature
created in the X-Naut labs.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 3, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
According to this, attacks
and items won't affect it if
it has Mini-Yux around it.
<k>
<p>
So, if any Mini-Yux appear,
take those out first. <wait 250>Duh!
<k> menu_enemy_016 Max HP: 3  Attack: 2
Defense: 0
These pathetically ugly
creatures were created in
the X-Naut laboratories.
With Mini-Yux around them,
they're impervious to all
attacks. btl_hlp_barriern_petit That's a Mini-Yux.
<wait 250>
A creature made to protect
a Yux, it can split into two.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 1, Attack is 0,
and  Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
These twerps are the reason
you sometimes can't do any
damage to the main Yux.
<k>
<p>
They're a pain, but you HAVE
to beat them before the Yux.
<wait 250>
Flurrie's pretty effective...
<k> menu_enemy_017 Max HP: 1  Attack: 0
Defense: 0
Each one can divide into two.
As long as you clear these
out first, ordinary Yux are
nothing to be feared. btl_hlp_majyorin That's Beldam.
<wait 250>
She's the oldest sister, the
leader of the Shadow Sirens.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 9, Attack is 1, and
Defense is 0.<wait 300> But her blizzard
attack has an Attack of 2.
<k>
<p>
She can make her partners
big and make us tiny, and
attacks with weird magic.
<k>
<p>
The worst thing about her is
that sinister snicker. <wait 250>She
sounds so totally evil!
<k>
<p>
I mean, she's just the sort
of person you want to avoid
like the plague, y'know?
<k> menu_enemy_104 Max HP: 9  Attack: 1
Defense: 0
The eldest sister and leader
of the Shadow Sirens, she
uses magic to attack. Her
personality stinks. btl_hlp_maririn That's Marilyn.

She's a Shadow Siren,
Beldam's younger sister.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 12, Attack is 2, and
Defense is 0.<wait 250> She charges
up her attacks occasionally.
<k>
<p>
Says here she's the toughest
of the sisters, so it might be
best to defeat her first, huh?
<k>
<p>
Other than that,<wait 250> she doesn't
have any particularly
outstanding characteristics.
<k> menu_enemy_108 Max HP: 12  Attack: 2
Defense: 0
She's one of the Shadow
Sirens, which makes her
Beldam's younger sister.
She has strong Attack power,
so it might be best to
defeat her first. btl_hlp_vivian That's Vivian.
<wait 250>
She's the youngest of the
three Shadow Sirens.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Attack is 1, and
Defense is 0.<wait 250> She doesn't
seem all that noteworthy.
<k>
<p>
Uh...<wait 250> She is kinda cute,
I guess...
<k>
<p>
She might even be cuter
than I am...
<k>
<p>
I guess...
<k>
<p>
...Uh...<wait 250> What am I thinking?
<k> menu_enemy_112 Max HP: 10  Attack: 1
Defense: 0.

It's a giant robot built by the
X-Nauts.<wait 250> Lord Crump drives it.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 30, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
Its most effective attack is
one that takes advantage of
its size: a smothering stomp.
<k>
<p>
It can also shoot out its fists,
which do these super-gnarly
rocket punches.
<k>
<p>
Its fists have Max HP of 2,
an Attack of 4, and Defense
of 0.
<k>
<p>
Its fists are super-powerful,
so it's best to knock them
down fast.
<k>
<p>
The thing about this robot is
<wait 250>
I can't tell if it looks cool,
or really, REALLY stupid...
<k> btl_hlp_rocket_punch Unused Message
GLOBAL 716
<k> menu_enemy_139 Max HP: 30  Attack: 2

A powerful and cutting-edge
robot built by X-Naut
scientists. It has all the
features expected of a robot,
including rocket fists. btl_hlp_nokonoko_fighter That's a KP Koopa.
<wait 250>
It's a Koopa Troopa of a
slightly different color.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 4, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
Looks like its abilities are
just like any Koopa...<wait 250> So he
oughta be a piece of cake!
<k>
<p>
Don't go easy just because
you know King K, Mario...
<wait 250>
That's what friends are for!
<k> menu_enemy_188 Max HP: 4  Attack: 2
Defense is 1
A Koopa warrior that battles
at the Glitz Pit in Glitzville.
It may be a different color
than your average Koopa, but
its abilities are the same. btl_hlp_patapata_fighter That's a KP Paratroopa.
<wait 250>
It's a Koopa Paratroopa of a
different color.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 4, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
Its attacks are the same as
your average, garden-variety
Koopa Paratroopa.
<k>
<p>
So, just do the same thing as
always: stomp on it, flip it,
and drop its Defense to 0.
<k>
<p>
My Headbonk is pretty
effective against it, too.
<wait 250>
Come on!<wait 250> Let's get him!
<k> menu_enemy_189 Max HP: 4  Attack: 2
Defense: 1
A Koopa Paratroopa who's
dyed its shell. Otherwise,
it's the same as any other
Paratroopa, which means one
stomp and it loses its wings. btl_hlp_sambo That's a Pokey.
<wait 250>
It's a cactus ghoul that's got
nasty spines all over its body.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 4, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Look at those spines... <wait 250>Those
would TOTALLY hurt.<wait 250> If you
stomp on it, you'll regret it.
<k>
<p>
Pokeys attack by lobbing
parts of their bodies and by
charging at you...
<k>
<p>
They can even call friends in
for help, so be quick about
taking them out.
<k> menu_enemy_055 Max HP: 4  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
A cactus ghoul covered from
head to base in nasty spines.
It attacks by lobbing sections

<wait 250>
It's a member of the Koopa
clan that rides on clouds.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 2, and
Defense is 0.<wait 300> It attacks
by throwing Spiny Eggs.
<k>
<p>
If you stomp on it when it's
holding up a Spiny Egg, you'll
take damage, so DON'T do it!
<k>
<p>
Spiny Eggs slowly hatch into
Spinies, so beat the Lakitu
before fighting the Spinies.
<k>
<p>
Aw, this book doesn't answer
my real question:<wait 250> where does
it keep all those Spiny Eggs?
<k> menu_enemy_084 Max HP: 5, Attack: 2
Defense: 0.
A cloud-riding member of the
Koopa tribe, Lakitu attacks
by throwing Spiny Eggs, which
slowly hatch into Spinies. btl_hlp_togezo That's a Spiny.

Basically a spike-covered
Koopa. <wait 250>Ugh! <wait 250>Looks <wait 100><shake>painful</shake>!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 3, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 3.
<k>
<p>
These things have such high
Defense that you can't even
hurt them when they roll up.
<k>
<p>
So, when they go back to
normal, do all the damage
you can, and do it quickly!
<k>
<p>
If you flip them over, their
Defense drops to 0. <wait 250>THAT'S
the time to take them out.
<k>
<p>
Jumping on them is just plain
stupid, so try using a POW
Block or some other item.
<k> menu_enemy_085 Max HP: 3  Attack: 3
Defense: 3
A spine-covered member of
the Koopa tribe with
extremely high Defense.
It cannot be damaged when
it rolls into a ball. btl_hlp_hyper_sinnosuke That's a Hyper Bald Cleft.
<wait 250>
Like Clefts and Bald Clefts,
this is also a rock monster.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 3, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
This hyper version can build
up its energy, boosting its
Attack to 8 on the next turn.
<k>
<p>
It has low HP, but its body is
rock-hard and impervious to
fire, making it super-tough.
<k>
<p>
It says here that item
attacks are pretty effective.
<wait 250>
Beat it before it goes hyper!
<k> menu_enemy_036 Max HP: 3  Attack: 2
Defense: 2
A hyperactive Bald Cleft
that can charge up energy,
boosting its Attack to 8. btl_hlp_bomhei That's a Bob-omb.

It attacks by blowing itself
up. <wait 250>Yeah. <wait 250>Reeeeeeeal smart.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 4, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
A Bob-omb will get totally
mad if you damage it. They
have like, super-short fuses.
<k>
<p>
When it gets mad, it'll charge
and explode on its next turn.
<wait 250>
THAT attack...<wait 250>really hurts.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and if it's mad, it'll blow
up at the slightest contact.
<wait 250>
So don't attack directly!
<k>
<p>
Attack it from a step away
with a hammer or hit it with
something hard, like a shell.
<k> menu_enemy_061 Max HP: 4  Attack: 2
Defense: 1
A round bomb soldier that
gets furious when damaged
and attacks by charging and
then exploding. btl_hlp_borodo_king That's a Big Bandit.
<wait 250>
Basically, a boss among
ordinary Bandits.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Unlike other Bandits, he'll
steal your items as well as
your coins. <wait 250>Totally weak!
<k>
<p>
If you guard well when he
charges at you, he'll blow by
without stealing anything.
<k>
<p>
If he robs you, you won't get
your item back unless you
beat him right then. <wait 250>He'll run!
<k> menu_enemy_190 Max HP: 8  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
A Bandit boss that steals
items as well as coins.
Guard when he charges at
you to hold on to your goods! btl_hlp_borodo That's a Bandit.
<wait 250>
This scumbag tries to bump
you and grab coins. <wait 250>Jerk!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
If you time your guard well
when he attacks, he won't be
able to steal anything.
<k>
<p>
Plus, the look on a Bandit's
face when you guard
successfully is priceless.
<k>
<p>
If a Bandit steals coins from
you, defeat him before he
flees to get your coins back.
<k> menu_enemy_077 Max HP: 5  Attack: 2
Defense: 0
A petty thief that charges
at people and tries to steal
coins. If you guard well,
though, he can't steal a

<wait 250>
It's the most well protected
of the Buzzy Beetle species.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 3, and
Defense is a whopping 5.
<wait 250><wave>
Yup... <wait 100>This guy is HARD!
</wave><k>
<p>
It has really high Defense,
and fire and explosions don't
hurt it at all.
<k>
<p>
If we can just find a way to
flip it over, its underside
has Defense of 0...
<k>
<p>
And that spike... <wait 250>What a pain!
<wait 250>
There's gotta be a way to
flip it over...
<k> menu_enemy_191 Max HP: 5  Attack: 3
Defense: 5
The sturdiest of all the
Buzzy Beetles, a Red Spike
Top is impervious to fire
and explosions. Plus, the
spike on its back protects
it from being flipped over. btl_hlp_ura_noko That's a Shady Koopa.
<wait 250>
It's yet another member of
the Koopa family tree.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
The difference between them
and other Koopas?<wait 250> They can
attack from their backs!
<k>
<p>
And, when they flip back up,
their Attack gets boosted
and they go totally ape!
<k>
<p>
...Wow!<wait 250> That's pretty tricky!
<wait 250>
No wonder they're called
Shady Koopas, huh?
<k> menu_enemy_031 Max HP: 8  Attack: 3
Defense: 1
When a Shady Koopa flips
back up from its back, its
Attack increases. Shady
Koopas have a place of honor
in the Koopa family tree
because of this distinction. btl_hlp_ura_pata That's a Shady Paratroopa.
<wait 250>
It's a Shady Koopa with
wings, obviously.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 3, and
Defense is 1.<wait 300> Knock off its
wings and it's a Shady Koopa.
<k>
<p>
Unlike typical Koopas and
Paratroopas, its Attack jumps
when it flips up off its back.
<k>
<p>
This also says it has a move
that hits you and your ally
at once. Is that <dynamic 3>possible?
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
Uh...<wait 250> I guess the best thing
to do is just beat it quickly
after we flip it.
<k> menu_enemy_032 Max HP: 8  Attack: 3
Defense: 1
Other than having wings, this
creature isn't very different
from a Shady Koopa. Once it
flips off its back, it boosts
its Attack. btl_hlp_kamec_red That's a Red Magikoopa.
<wait 250>
It's a Koopa wizard dressed
in red.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Besides using offensive magic,
it can also use magic to
boost Attack and Defense.
<k>
<p>
When it's alone, this wizard
will use magic to multiply.
<k>
<p>
The fact that you can't tell
which is the real one after it
multiplies is super-annoying.
<k>
<p>
I have to say, though, that
shade of red is definitely
NOT its color.
<k> menu_enemy_169 Max HP: 7  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
This red-garbed Koopa wizard
uses a wide variety of magic,
including Attack- and
Defense-boosting spells. btl_hlp_kamec_red_bunshin That's a Red Magikoopa Copy.

There's no point in attacking
it, since you can't hurt it.
<k>
<p>
The real thing has a Max HP
of 7, an Attack of 4, and a
Defense of 0.
<k>
<p>
Once you beat the real one,

So, uh, find that real one!
<k> btl_hlp_kamec_white That's a White Magikoopa.
<wait 250>
It's a Koopa wizard dressed
in white.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 4,

<k>
<p>
It attacks with magic and
can replenish its allies' HP.
<wait 250>
Better hit it first, huh?
<k>
<p>
Oh, this also says it'll use
magic to make copies of itself
when it's all alone.
<k>
<p>
...Which is totally lame, 'cause
then you can't tell the real
deal from the copy!
<k> menu_enemy_170 Max HP: 7  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
A white-robed Koopa wizard
that uses a wide variety of
magic, including magic that
replenishes its own HP and

magic to make copies of itself
when it's all alone.
<k>
<p>
...Which is totally lame, 'cause
then you can't tell the real
deal from the copy!
<k> menu_enemy_171 Max HP: 7  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
A green-robed Koopa wizard
that uses a variety of magic
spells, including ones that
electrify allies or make
them invisible. btl_hlp_kamec_green_bunshin That's a Green Magikoopa
Copy.<wait 250> No point in attacking
it, since you can't hurt it.
<k>

The real thing has a Max HP

Defense of 0.

<wait 250>
Yikes.<wait 250> What a ghastly-looking
spear-thrower.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 20, Attack is 6,
and Defense is 0.<wait 250> Wow, that's
some serious Attack power.
<k>
<p>
You don't wanna jump on it
if its spear is pointing up.
<wait 250>
'Cause that...<wait 250>would hurt.
<k>
<p>
For a run-of-the-mill spear-
tosser, he sure looks like he's
got a POINT to make!<wait 250> Ha ha!
<k> menu_enemy_184 Max HP: 20  Attack: 6
Defense: 0
A ghastly-looking spearman
that'll poke your feet if you
try to stomp it when its
spear is pointing up. It
attacks by throwing spears
or charging. btl_hlp_hammer_bros That's a Hammer Bro.
<wait 250>
You know him.<wait 250> He throws
hammers.<wait 250> Hence the name.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
When his HP drops and he
thinks he's in trouble, he'll
toss a hammer barrage.
<k>
<p>
Nothing about these guys has
changed: they're tough as
ever, so brace yourself!
<k>
<p>
Dang! <wait 250>This book always skips
the important stuff!<wait 250> How do
they carry endless hammers!
<k> menu_enemy_067 Max HP: 7  Attack: 4
Defense: 1
Well-known for their vicious

Hammer Bros. have a
reputation as one of Mario's
toughest enemies... btl_hlp_boomerang_bros That's a Boomerang Bro.
<wait 250>
This relative of the Hammer
Bros. prefers boomerangs.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 2,

<k>
<p>
He attacks twice with his
boomerangs: <wait 250>on the way out
AND on the way back.
<k>
<p>
When his HP starts getting
low, he fights all the harder.
<wait 250>
Prepare for multiple attacks!
<k> menu_enemy_068 Max HP: 7  Attack: 2
Defense: 1
A Koopa who uses
boomerangs instead of
hammers. Beware of
returning boomerangs! btl_hlp_fire_bros That's a Fire Bro.
<wait 250>
This relative of the Hammer
Bros. spits out fire.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
If you get hit by a fireball,
you might catch on fire, so
guard well, OK?
<k>
<p>
When his HP gets low, he gets
desperate and totally starts
attacking like a fiend.
<k> menu_enemy_069 Max HP: 7  Attack: 3

Bros. who can spit fire.

chewing, chomping fool!

and Defense is 3.
<k>
<p>
Its attacks are so powerful,
we could be in a world of
hurt if we don't beat it fast!
<k>
<p>
...Which is why it's really,
REALLY lame that its
Defense is so high.
<k>
<p>
Its HP is pretty low, though,
so items and special moves
might just work...
<k>
<p>
Just look at that color!<wait 250> Think
someone painted it after it
fell asleep at a party?
<k> menu_enemy_185 Max HP: 6  Attack: 5
Defense: 3

Attack and Defense are high.
Rumor has it that it's so
angry because someone

<wait 250>
These guys just totally ooze
toughness, don'tcha think?
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 25, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
After it charges up power,
its next attack will be
devastating. Try to survive it.
<k>
<p>
It's almost like those red
eyes are there to warn you
just how tough it is...
<k>
<p>
Or maybe it just doesn't get
much sleep...
<k> menu_enemy_175 Max HP: 25  Attack: 5
Defense: 2
A member of the elite forces

of red eyes is its most
charming feature. After

</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
What's WITH this book?
<wait 250>
It says no attack will work
against Iron Clefts!
<k>
<p>
It says nothing in the world
is as hard as an Iron Cleft, so
its Defense is impenetrable.
<k>
<p>
If that's true, the only way
to beat one is to whack it
with the other one...
<k>
<p>
Running away may not be a
bad idea at this point.
<k> menu_enemy_038 Max HP: 6  Attack: 4
Defense: Unknown
No attacks can pierce the
Defense of this hard, metallic
Cleft. Are they impossible
to defeat??? btl_hlp_iron_sinemon2 That's an Iron Cleft.

<k> menu_enemy_039 Max HP: 6  Attack: 4
Defense: Unknown
No attacks can pierce the
Defense of this hard, metallic
Cleft. Since this one is
wearing green shoes, it must
be the younger brother. btl_hlp_koopa_tou That's Bowser!
<wait 250>
But what's he doing here?!?
<wait 250>
My mind just blew a fuse!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 30, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 1.<wait 250> He's
uglier than I expected.
<k>
<p>
He's got a poisonous bite,
so watch out!<wait 250> It'll make your
HP decrease gradually.
<k>
<p>
Also, if he ground-pounds
you, you won't be able to
use one of your commands!
<k>
<p>
Just focus your attention on
beating him down, Mario!
<k> menu_enemy_187 Max HP: 30  Attack: 3
Defense: 1
Mario's fated enemy, Bowser
the Koopa king is a foe to
be feared. His typical
turf is NOT Glitzville. btl_hlp_champion That's Rawk Hawk!
<wait 250>
He flips, flaps, and slaps!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
...That's what the book says.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 40, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
He's really good at aerial
maneuvers, but other than
that, he's pretty...<wait 250>meh.
<k>
<p>
One thing you should know
is that Rawk Hawk NEVER
fights above the board.
<k>
<p>
Carelessness leads to
lifelessness, y'know!
<k> menu_enemy_142 Max HP: 40  Attack: 3
Defense: 1
A champion fighter. Battling
him requires a certain level
of artistry. "You wanna hate
me, but you can't help but
love the RAAAAAAAWWWWK!" btl_hlp_macho_gansu That's Macho Grubba.
<wait 250>
He's Grubba all souped-up on
Crystal Star power.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 60, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
His attack pattern is simple:
first he increases the number
of times he can attack...
<k>
<p>
Then he powers himself up
with all sorts of crazy,
power-uppy moves.
<k>
<p>
So, it's pretty important to
pay close attention to how
he's powered himself up.
<k>
<p>
The craziest thing about this
musclehead is that he used
to be that chubby Grubba.
<k>
<p>
I guess the Crystal Stars
really ARE powerful!
<k> menu_enemy_141 Max HP: 60  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
Macho Grubba has the
confidence to match his
muscles after being powered
up by the Crystal Star. btl_hlp_hyper_kuriboo That's a Hyper Goomba.
<wait 250>
Which means...<wait 250> Umm...<wait 250> It's a
hyperactive Goomba.<wait 250> Duh!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
But if this nut goes <shake>BIZZ-ZOW
</shake>
and charges up, his Attack
power will be 8 next turn!
<k>
<p>
So you'd better wipe it out
between the time it charges
up and the time it attacks!
<k>
<p>
And if you can't beat him,
then run away, OK?
<k> menu_enemy_023 Max HP: 8  Attack: 2
Defense: 0
When this hyperactive
Goomba charges up, its
Attack rises to 8, so watch
yourself! btl_hlp_hyper_togekuri That's a Hyper Spiky Goomba.
<wait 250>
It's a Hyper Goomba with a
spike on its head.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
After charging up, its Attack
power rises to an incredible
level of <dynamic 3>9!</dynamic><wait 250><shake> That's SCARY...
</shake>
<k>
<p>
Beat it before it attacks,
or you'll be in peril before
you know it, seriously.
<k>
<p>
If only this book listed a
way to dodge that attack...
<k> menu_enemy_024 Max HP: 8  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
When this spike-headed
Hyper Goomba charges up,
its Attack power rises to
9, so heads up! btl_hlp_hyper_patakuri That's a Hyper Paragoomba.
<wait 250>
It's basically just a Hyper
Goomba with wings.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
After charging up, you'll be
dealing with moves that have
an Attack power of 8.
<k>
<p>
Once you damage it, it'll lose
its wings and turn into a
regular Hyper Goomba.
<k>
<p>
Not that THAT'S all that
cool. <wait 250>Even normal Hyper
Goombas are dangerous.
<k> menu_enemy_025 Max HP: 8  Attack: 2
Defense: 0
When this winged Hyper
Goomba charges up, its
Attack power rises to 8. btl_hlp_pansy That's a Crazee Dayzee.
<wait 250>
It may look totally cute,
but it's a serious foe.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 2,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
What you gotta worry about
is its lullaby.<wait 250> That tune will
totally zonk you out.
<k>
<p>
If you manage to guard well,
though, you might not pass
out.<wait 250> Try to learn the timing.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and when its HP runs low,
it runs away, so try to KO
it in one fell swoop.
<k> menu_enemy_082 Max HP: 7  Attack: 2
Defense: 0
This fleet-footed flower
foe is super-cute, and it
sings one hypnotically
sleepy lullaby. btl_hlp_twinkling_pansy That's an Amazy Dayzee.
<wait 250>
This mystical Dayzee is like,
the rarest thing ever.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 20, Attack is 20,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
Since it has such high HP
and runs away really quickly,
it's almost impossible to beat.
<k>
<p>
Plus, its lullaby has massive
Attack power, so if we're low
on HP, we need to scram.
<k>
<p>
You gotta think hard about
whether to fight or bolt.
<k> menu_enemy_083 Max HP: 20  Attack: 20
Defense: 1
A mystical Dayzee that's
almost never seen. Since it
has such high HP, and since
it's so quick to run away,
this creature is almost
impossible to beat. btl_hlp_hyper_sinemon That's a Hyper Cleft.
<wait 250>
It's basically a Cleft that
uses charged-up moves.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 4, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 3.
<k>
<p>
When it charges up, its
Attack power rises to 9.
<k>
<p>
Couple its rock-hardness with
its ability to charge up...
<wait 100>
and things get scary.
<k>
<p>
If you're confident, you may
wanna try doing Superguards
to send its attacks back...
<k>
<p>
If you can't, you'd better use
some items, or you'd better
hightail it out of here.
<k> menu_enemy_037 Max HP: 4  Attack: 3
Defense: 3
A hyperactive Cleft that
uses charge moves to boost
its Attack power to 9. btl_hlp_met That's a Buzzy Beetle.
<wait 250>
Awww...<wait 100> It's kinda cute!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 4.
<k>
<p>
It's got pretty good Defense...
<wait 250>
and fire and explosions don't
hurt it whatsoever.
<k>
<p>
But, if you jump on it, you
can flip it over and drop
its Defense down to 0.
<k>
<p>
Then it's at our mercy!<wait 250> Ha!
<wait 250>
Don't hesitate!<wait 250> Jump!<wait 250> Jump!
Jump jump jump!
<k> menu_enemy_048 Max HP: 5  Attack: 3
Defense: 4
It's well protected and
immune to fire or explosions,
but if you flip it over, its
Defense drops to zero. btl_hlp_togemet That's a Spike Top.
<wait 250>
It's a Buzzy Beetle with a
spike on its back.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 4.
<k>
<p>
Like other Buzzies, fire and
explosions have absolutely no
effect on it.
<k>
<p>
But, you can flip it over to
drop its Defense to 0!
<k>
<p>
I'm sure you know this
already, but try not to jump
on it. <wait 250>That spike hurts.
<k> menu_enemy_049 Max HP: 5  Attack: 3
Defense: 4
This Buzzy has high Defense
and a pointy spike on its
shell. You'll take damage if
you stomp on it. btl_hlp_basabasa That's a Swooper.
<wait 250>
I bet they call it that 'cause
of the way it swoops around.
<k>
<p>
<wait 250><dynamic 3>
Wow!<wait 250> That's some AWESOME
naming work. <wait 250>Seriously!
</dynamic><wait 250>
It's <dynamic 3><wait 100>pure naming genius!!!
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
So,<wait 100> anyway...
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 6, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.<wait 300> Says here
it hangs from the ceiling.
<k>
<p>
If you can just damage it, it
oughta drop off the ceiling.
<wait 300>
And then you can whack it!
<k> menu_enemy_040 Max HP: 6  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
A roosting creature that
will hang from the ceiling
until damaged. btl_hlp_teresa That's a Boo.
<wait 250>
It's everyone's favorite ghost.
<wait 250>
...Well, most everyone...
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
It's nothing to write home
about on the Attack side,
but it can turn invisible.
<k>
<p>
If it turns invisible, we
won't be able to hit it, so
beat it while you can see it.
<k>
<p>
Boos are kinda cute, but I
sure wouldn't want to meet
one in a dark alley.
<k>
<p>
If I ran into one in the
bathroom in the middle of
the night, I'd...
<k>
<p>
Well, never you mind what
I'd do.
<k> menu_enemy_052 Max HP: 7  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
A somewhat shy ghost that
can make itself and its allies
invisible. It may be a ghost,
but it's pretty cute. btl_hlp_atomic_teresa That's an Atomic Boo.
<wait 250>
It's a giant Boo made up of
a ton of smaller Boos.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 40, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
This thing will try to smoosh
us. It can also split up and
send hundreds of Boos at us.
<k>
<p>
And, when we attack, we
might get so scared that we
get confused or can't move.
<k>
<p>
I sure wouldn't want to see
this thing standing behind me
in the middle of the night...
<k>
<p><shake>
Creeeeeepy...
<k> menu_enemy_054 Max HP: 40  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
A massive creature made up
of countless Boos. It attacks
by breaking apart and
sending out hundreds of Boos. btl_hlp_hatena ...???
<k>
<p>
Wow, how totally bizarre...
<wait 250>
This thing isn't listed in here.
<k>
<p>
There's a monster in here
that looks like this thing...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
But it doesn't list a name.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 40, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
It's apparently really good
at transforming itself and
other things.
<k>
<p>
Maybe it used that power to
turn the villagers into pigs!
<wait 250>
This thing is a real jerk!
<k> btl_hlp_ranperu That's Doopliss.
<col c00000ff>REPORT THIS AS A BUG
Global #796.
<k> menu_enemy_124 Max HP: 40  Attack: 4
Defense: 0 
This is the beast that's
plunged Twilight Town into
the depths of fear and
despair. It enjoys turning
innocent people into pigs. btl_hlp_hermos That's an Ember.
<wait 250>
Sort of a pale-blue flame
spirit. <wait 250>Kind of spooky.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Of course, since this thing is
a flame, touching it will hurt.
<wait 250>
Didn't Mama teach you that?
<k>
<p>
Looks like it's susceptible
to ice or explosive attacks,
though, so that's something.
<k>
<p>
If you get hit by a flame
attack, you'll catch fire,
so try to guard well.
<k> menu_enemy_081 Max HP: 8  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
These blue flame spirits are
susceptible to ice and
explosive attacks. They're
said to be vengeful spirits
of the recent dead. btl_hlp_bubble That's a Lava Bubble.
<wait 250>
It's a flame spirit.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 6, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Its HP and Attack power may
be different from an Ember's,
but otherwise it's the same.
<k>
<p>
Since it is made of fire,
try not to touch it, 'cause
it'll burn you.
<k>
<p>
Apparently it's vulnerable to
explosions and ice attacks.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and if you get hit by a
flame attack, you might
catch fire, so guard well.
<k> menu_enemy_080 Max HP: 6  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
This flame spirit is
vulnerable to explosions and
ice attacks. If you stomp on
it, you'll take damage. btl_hlp_green_chorobon That's a Green Fuzzy.
<wait 250>
As you can see, it's a Fuzzy,
and it's green. <wait 250>Duh!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
This is similar to a normal
Fuzzy, so it replenishes its
own HP as it sucks out ours.
<k>
<p>
<shake>
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW...
</shake><wait 250>
That is just the grossest
thing ever.
<k>
<p>
...If you don't find that idea
gross, seriously, there's
something wrong with you.
<k>
<p>
The main difference between
this and other Fuzzies is
that this one multiplies.
<k>
<p>
You know, I bet this thing
would look great sitting next
to a Gold Fuzzy.
<k> menu_enemy_042 Max HP: 5  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
This minty Fuzzy replenishes
its HP as it drains yours.
And it can multiply. btl_hlp_flower_chorobon That's a Flower Fuzzy.
<wait 250>
Wow, what a totally pretty
Fuzzy, don'tcha think?
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 6, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
This thing attacks by boinging
in and sucking out FP.
<wait 250>
How uncool!<wait 250> We need FP!
<k>
<p>
Once it charges up its own
FP, it uses magical attacks.
<wait 250>
Better beat it before it does.
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>Oh!</dynamic> <wait 100>I just got it!
<k>
<p>
It's a Flower Fuzzy because it
sucks your FP (Flower Points)!
<wait 250>
Duuuuuuh!<wait 250> Hee hee!
<k> menu_enemy_043 Max HP: 6  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
A Fuzzy with lovely coloring.
It'll suck your FP and attack
with magic when full. btl_hlp_poison_pakkun That's a Putrid Piranha.
<wait 250>
It's a poisonous Piranha Plant.
<wait 300>
That color is totally sickly...
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
It bites, AND it attacks with
super-rank poison breath.
<wait 250>
Breath mint, table four!
<k>
<p>
If you get poisoned, your HP
will slowly go down, so,
y'know, try not to.
<k> menu_enemy_046 Max HP: 8  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
A poisonous Piranha Plant.
It'll poison your allies.
Use your Guard effectively
to avoid poisoning. btl_hlp_killer That's a Bullet Bill.
<wait 250>
It attacks after being shot
from a Bill Blaster.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 2, Attack is 4,
Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
Take care of it quickly, or
it'll totally whale into you,
mosh-pit style!
<k>
<p>
Use those Action Commands
and take it out!
<k> menu_enemy_057 Max HP: 2  Attack: 4
Defense: 1
A projectile that attacks
after being shot from a Bill
Blaster. Take it out before
it slams into you. btl_hlp_killer_cannon That's a Bill Blaster.
<wait 250>
It's the cannon that shoots
Bullet Bills.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Defense is 2.
<wait 250>
It doesn't attack directly,
but shoots Bullet Bills at you.
<k>
<p>
I know the Bullet Bills are
annoying, but take out the
Bill Blaster first, trust me.
<k>
<p>
Arrgh!<wait 100> How many of those
things will it shoot at us?!?
<wait 250>
YOU'RE SO ANNOYING!
<k> menu_enemy_059 Max HP: 5  Defense: 2
A large black cannon that
shoots Bullet Bills. Unknown
whether it is alive or not. btl_hlp_patamet That's a Parabuzzy.
<wait 250>
A Buzzy Beetle with wings.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 3, and
Defense is 4.<wait 250> I guess those
stats are just like a Buzzy.
<k>
<p>
Fire and explosions seem to
have no effect, so don't
bother, OK?
<k>
<p>
If you flip it over, its
Defense goes down to 0, so
jump on it first.
<k> menu_enemy_050 Max HP: 5  Attack: 3
Defense: 4
A Buzzy with wings and high
Defense. It flies in the air,
but it'll come down if you
stomp on it. btl_hlp_heavy_bom That's a Bulky Bob-omb.
<wait 250>
I think it's like other
Bob-ombs...<wait 300>but it's huge!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 6, Attack is 2,
Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
It's weird...<wait 250> It never attacks,
but once its fuse is lit, it'll
blow up on its own eventually.
<k>
<p>
I don't mind it taking itself
out of the battle, but that
explosion hurts us, too!
<k>
<p>
Oh, and when it powers up,
that Attack power is 8,
so watch out!
<k>
<p>
Fire and explosions light its
fuse, so I guess setting it
off early is one strategy...
<k>
<p>
You can run, too, but if you're
gonna fight, beat it before it
goes off!
<k> menu_enemy_064 Max HP: 6  Attack: 2
Defense: 1
A big pink Bob-omb that
explodes after 4 turns.
That explosion is big, so
take it out before then. btl_hlp_cortez <dynamic 3>
That's Cortez!
</dynamic><k>
<p>
He's the dreaded pirate
spirit who haunts the island!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 20, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
His HP may seem low, but he's
a spirit, so even when his
HP hits 0, he'll come back.
<k>
<p>
Plus, he has tons of different
attacks. <wait 250>He's as tough and
scary as he looks.
<k>
<p>
I'd say just keep damaging
him,<wait 250> and sooner or later he'll
go down for good!
<k>
<p>
Let's give this tormented
spirit some eternal rest!
<k> menu_enemy_132 Max HP: 20  Attack: 4
Defense: 1
A pirate spirit who stayed
in Keelhaul Key to guard
his treasure. btl_hlp_kanbu3 That's Lord Crump.
<wait 250>
Not this guy again...<wait 100> Ugh.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 30, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
He just attacks normally, so
don't worry much about him...
<k>
<p>
But...those X-Nauts all around
him are a force to be
reckoned with.
<k>
<p>
They're going to attack us
with all kinds of weird moves,
I can just FEEL it!
<k>
<p>
If we take out their leader,
though, they won't have the
focus to attack.<wait 250> Get Crump!
<k> menu_enemy_144 Max HP: 30  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
The X-Naut leader. He likes
to attack with body slams.
Always an interesting foe... btl_hlp_gundan_zako_group1 That's an X-Naut platoon.
<wait 250>
Crump commands them all.
<wait 250>
Where'd they come from?
<k>
<p>
Their Max HP depends on
their condition, but Attack
is 5 and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
They're gonna come at us
with coordinated group
maneuvers, I'm sure.
<k>
<p>
...But they're pretty wimpy, so
we should be able to handle
it, don'tcha think?

<wait 250>
Don't confuse them with
Dark Puffs...
<k>
<p>
Although I don't think the
world would end if you DID
confuse them, but anyway...
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
They swoop at you or charge
themselves with electricity
before unleashing lightning.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and if you touch them
while they're charged, you'll
get a shock!
<k> menu_enemy_065 Max HP: 7  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
A relative of the Dark Puff...
or perhaps just a different-
colored one. It charges up
and shocks you with lightning. btl_hlp_sambo_mummy That's a Poison Pokey.
<wait 250>
As you probably guessed, it's
a poisonous Pokey.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
If you get poisoned, your HP
will slowly drain, so you
may want to avoid that.
<k>
<p>
I'm sure you can see this, but
they have spines all over,
so DON'T touch them.
<k>
<p>
They may be smiling, but that
doesn't mean they're happy
to see you!
<k> menu_enemy_056 Max HP: 8  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
A poisonous Pokey that
attacks with poison and
sometimes calls in friends.
Take it out quickly. btl_hlp_patatogemet That's a Spiky Parabuzzy.
<wait 250>
It's a Buzzy with a spike
and wings.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 5, Attack is 3, and
Defense is 4.<wait 250> Hey! <wait 250>The same
stats as a normal Buzzy!
<k>
<p>
Fire and explosions don't
work on Buzzies, in case
you've forgotten.
<k>
<p>
...And this one flies in the air
AND has a spike.<wait 250> What a
total pain.
<k>
<p>
So...you'd better use an item
or a special move.
<k> menu_enemy_051 Max HP: 5  Attack: 3
Defense: 4
A Buzzy with wings and a
spike. It flies, so a hammer
won't reach. It's hard to find
attacks that work. btl_hlp_purple_teresa That's a Dark Boo.
<wait 250>
Purple just looks...<wait 250>so wrong.
<wait 250>
These Boos are SO creepy.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Its HP and Attack are high,
but they're just like ordinary
Boos otherwise.
<k>
<p>
So, just attack it like a
normal Boo.<wait 250> Get it before
it turns invisible!
<k> menu_enemy_053 Max HP: 8  Attack: 5
Defense: 0
A creepy-looking Boo with
high HP and Attack. Get it
before it turns invisible! btl_hlp_moamoa That's a Smorg.
<wait 250>
Lots of Smorgs gathered to
create this huge monster.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 50, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 1.<wait 250> It attacks
with weird tentacles.
<k>
<p>
Defeating the tentacles will
drop the body's Defense to 0,
making it easier to attack.
<k>
<p>
The tentacles will regenerate,
but use that time to deal a
ton of damage, OK?
<k>
<p>
It may also take other forms
with higher Attack powers,
I don't really know.
<k>
<p>
Let's just hurry and beat this
thing down so we can save
those trapped passengers!
<k> menu_enemy_118 Max HP: 50  Attack: 5
Defense: 1
A monster made of tons of
smaller Smorgs. It uses Smorg
tentacles to attack. btl_hlp_bllizard That's an Ice Puff.
<wait 250>
It's a mean snow cloud that
appears in cold areas.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 9, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
It swoops down and uses cold
breath to attack. <wait 250>Trust me,
it's NOT refreshing.
<k>
<p>
That cold breath can freeze
us, so try to avoid it.
<k>
<p>
Also, if we touch it when it's
storing cold energy, we'll get
hurt. <wait 250>Isn't that super-weak?
<k>
<p>
They're vulnerable to fire,
so let's try that, maybe.
<k> menu_enemy_066 Max HP: 9  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
Ruff Puff's chilly brother,
it will sometimes freeze you
with cold breath. btl_hlp_ice_pakkun That's a Frost Piranha.
<wait 250>
It's a cool customer with
strong ice powers.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Its biting attack sometimes
freezes us, so try to
immobilize it first.
<k>
<p>
It's weak against fire attacks,
too, so use them as well.
<k> menu_enemy_047 Max HP: 10  Attack: 5
Defense: 0
A Piranha Plant with ice
powers that's weak against
fire. Its biting attack
sometimes freezes you. btl_hlp_sinemon That's a Moon Cleft.
<wait 250>
It's your basic Cleft living on
the moon.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 6, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 5.
<k>
<p>
Defense is high, as usual...
<wait 250>
and fire attacks don't work
against it.
<k>
<p>
If you can turn it over with
an explosion, though, its
Defense goes down to 0.
<k> menu_enemy_034 Max HP: 6  Attack: 5
Defense: 5.
A Cleft living on the moon.
Its Defense is high, but if
you turn it over with an
explosion, its Defense goes
down to 0. btl_hlp_barriern_z That's a Z-Yux.
<wait 250>
It's a genetic improvement
on the original Yux.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Multiple Mini-Z-Yux will
appear to protect the main
unit, as you'd expect.
<k>
<p>
Sometimes they also restore
HP to the main unit, which
really burns me up!
<k>
<p>
It doesn't have much HP, but
those barriers often protect
it from attacks.
<k> menu_enemy_073 Max HP: 7  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
A genetic improvement on the
original Yux. Mini-Z-Yux often
appear to restore HP or
protect the main unit from
damage. btl_hlp_barriern_z_petit That's a Mini-Z-Yux.
<wait 250>
It lives to protect the Z-Yux.
<wait 250>
There can be as many as 4.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 2, Attack is 0,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
If you don't clear these guys
out, you'll never be able to
attack the Z-Yux.
<k>
<p>
Using a multiple-strike attack
to take them out all at once
is a totally good idea.
<k>
<p>
I mean, I respect them for
protecting their...<wait 250>whatever,
but they get NO mercy!
<k> menu_enemy_074 Max HP: 2  Attack is 0
Defense: 0
A protector of the Z-Yux.
There can be as many as 4.
They must all be defeated
to make the Z-Yux vulnerable. btl_hlp_barriern_custom That's an X-Yux.
<wait 250>
I hear this is read as "Cross"-
Yux, not as "Ex"-Yux.
<k>
<p>
Anyway, this is a new Yux
designed to protect extra-
important areas...
<k>
<p>
They were designed to be
unbeatable.<wait 250> They're not.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
It can produce two
Mini-X-Yuxes at once.
<k>
<p>
AND, it has an excellent
success rate of immobilizing
opponents.
<k>
<p>
We gotta do something about
that if we're gonna win.
<k> menu_enemy_179 Max HP: 10  Attack: 3
Defense: 1
A new Yux designed to
protect important areas.
Its attacks will sometimes
immobilize you. btl_hlp_barriern_custom_satellite That's a Mini-X-Yux.
<wait 250>
It lives to protect the X-Yux.
<wait 250>
Up to 4 can guard the X-Yux.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 1, Attack is 0,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
You can't attack the main
unit until you clear these
annoying pests out.
<k>
<p>
So use multiple-strike attacks
to take them out all at once!
<k> menu_enemy_180 Max HP: 1  Attack: 0
Defense: 0
A protector of the X-Yux.
You can't attack the main
unit until you clear these
things out. btl_hlp_gundan_zako_magician That's an X-Naut PhD.
<wait 250>
Guys like this invent all the
annoying things we fight.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 9, Attack is 4, and
Defense is 0.<wait 250> He likes to
throw beakers of chemicals.
<k>
<p>
The chemicals do all kinds of
stuff, like making things
huge or burning people.
<k>
<p>
He may also use potions to
heal himself or make himself
impossible to hit.
<k>
<p>
X-Naut PhDs are REALLY
annoying,<wait 250> so take them out
before they boost themselves.
<k> menu_enemy_075 Max HP: 9  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
An X-Naut that throws
chemicals. Research is
ongoing about the effects
of the chemicals they throw. btl_hlp_gundan_zako_elite That's an Elite X-Naut.
<wait 250>
This guy is the creme de la
creme of the X-Nauts.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
He'll use regular attacks as
well as boosting his power
or size.
<k>
<p>
Elite X-Nauts are tough,
but you just have to smack
away until they go down.
<k> menu_enemy_076 Max HP: 10  Attack: 5
Defense: 1
The pinnacle of the X-Naut
troops, this soldier tackles
and throws potions. Elite
X-Nauts may be enhanced
with nutrients developed by
X-Naut PhDs. btl_hlp_magnum_battender_mkII Ah!<wait 250> Magnus Von Grapple 2.0.
<wait 250>
The upgraded version of
Magnus Von Grapple.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 70, Attack is 6,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
Its basic attack is a drill
move that drops from above.
<k>
<p>
It also sometimes releases its
fists for flying X-Punches.
<k>
<p>
Each X-Punch has a Max HP
of 5, and Attack of 9, and
a Defense of 0.
<k>
<p>
When those fists are flying,
you may get attacked by the
fists and body in one turn...
<k>
<p>
Take care of those low-HP
fists early on, trust me.
<k>
<p>
When the body's HP gets low,
it'll also fire machine guns
and who knows what else.
<k>
<p>
It may not look too different
from the last version, but it's
much stronger, so be careful!
<k>
<p>
I still think the whole design
is a little ridiculous, though...
<k> btl_hlp_rocket_punch_mkII ???????0???
<k> menu_enemy_140 Max HP: 70  Attack: 6
Defense: 2
The biggest upgrades seem to
be the flying features.
Watch out for the improved
machine gun. btl_hlp_basabasa_chururu That's a Swoopula.
<wait 250>
An airborne, bloodsucking,
batlike thing.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 9, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
As if losing HP wasn't bad
enough, this little creep adds
yours to its own!
<k>
<p>
How totally, totally gross!
<wait 250>
Don't let it bite me, Mario!
<k> menu_enemy_041 Max HP: 9  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
An HP-sucking, batlike thing.
Its name comes from its
swooping, bloodsucking
attack. btl_hlp_phantom That's a Phantom Ember.
<wait 250>
It's an angry spirit born of
hatred and confusion.
<k>
<p>
<wait 150>
So, um...<wait 150> I'm not too cool
with this thing!
<wait 250>
<shake>
B-B-B-B-Bleck...
</shake>
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
If it attacks you with spirit
flames, you'll catch on fire.
<k>
<p>
Let's send this ghoul back
to the grave, OK?
<shake>
P-P-P-P-Please...
</shake>
<k> menu_enemy_178 Max HP: 10  Attack: 5
Defense: 0
An angry spirit from beyond.
Its flame attack will set you
on fire. btl_hlp_super_killer_cannon That's a B. Bill Blaster.
<wait 250>
It fires Bombshell Bills.
<wait 250>
Sorry about the abbreviation.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Defense is 4.
<wait 250>
It's really, really tough.
<wait 250>
Yeah, hard to hurt this guy.
<k>
<p>
Thing is, if you don't take
it out, it'll keep shooting
Bombshell Bills at you.
<k>
<p>
So, you gotta figure out a
way to beat it, and fast!
<k> menu_enemy_060 Max HP: 10  Defense: 4
A much tougher Bill Blaster.
It's really strong, but if
you don't beat it, it'll keep
shooting Bombshell Bills. btl_hlp_super_killer That's a Bombshell Bill.
<wait 250>
B. Bill Blasters shoot these
things repeatedly.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 3, Attack is 6,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
Its Attack is high, but its HP
is low, so take it out before
it takes YOU out!
<k>
<p>
Then again, if you focus on
these guys, you'll never win.
<wait 250>
Smack that B. Bill Blaster!
<k> menu_enemy_058 Max HP: 3  Attack: 6
Defense: 2
A souped-up Bullet Bill.
It'll hit you hard if you
don't take it out first.
Its HP is low, so do it
quickly! btl_hlp_wanwan That's a Chain-Chomp.
<wait 250>
I'd hate to get chomped by
those teeth. <wait 250>They look nasty.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 6,
and Defense is 5.
<k>
<p>
Its body is hard, so most
attacks won't do much.
<k>
<p>
Plus, you can't damage it
with fire and ice attacks.
<wait 250>
You can freeze it, though.
<k>
<p>
Luckily, it has low HP, so
you could take it down with
a special move or an item.
<k>
<p>
Chomp-Chomps are like, so
super-pumped all the time.
<wait 250>
Don't they ever get tired?
<k> menu_enemy_079 Max HP: 7  Attack: 6
Defense: 5
It's tough to damage this
creature, but it has low HP,
so it's possible to take it
out with one decisive blow. btl_hlp_super_mahorn That's a Dark Wizzerd.
<wait 250>
It's a part-machine, part-
organic, centuries-old thing.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
It uses magic to attack and
to alter your condition,
so stay on guard.
<k>
<p>
If there's only one left,
it'll multiply itself to
confuse you.
<k>
<p>
I know they look totally
goofy, but they're actually
pretty tough enemies.
<k> menu_enemy_071 Max HP: 10  Attack: 5
Defense: 2
A part-machine, part-organic,
magic-using entity. It'll
multiply itself to confuse you. btl_hlp_super_mahorn_bunsin That's a Dark Wizzerd illusion.
<wait 250>
There's no point in attacking
it, so don't bother.
<k>
<p>
The real Dark Wizzerd has a
Max HP of 10, an Attack of 5,
and a Defense of 2.
<k>
<p>
If you attack the real one,
the illusions will vanish.
<wait 250>
So find the real one!
<k> btl_hlp_karon That's a Dry Bones.
<wait 250>
It's a former Koopa whose
spirit animates its bones.
<k>
<p>
<shake>
Eeeeeek! <wait 100>That's so freaky!
</shake>
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
When its HP goes down to 0,
it collapses into a pile, but
it'll eventually rise again.
<k>
<p>
Fire and explosions will put
a permanent end to it
getting back up, though.
<k>
<p>
A Dry Bones will sometimes
build friends if it feels
it's outnumbered.
<k>
<p>
If you don't take them all
out close together, they'll
just keep coming back.
<k>
<p>
Let's wipe them out all at
once, and quick!<wait 250> These things
totally freak me out!
<k> menu_enemy_044 Max HP: 8  Attack: 5
Defense: 2
A skeleton Koopa that
sometimes builds friends.
Even after it collapses at
0 HP, it will sometimes
get back up. btl_hlp_black_karon That's a Dark Bones.
<wait 250>
It's the baddest of the
Bones gang.
</shake>
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 20, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
When its HP goes down to 0,
it collapses into a pile, but
it'll eventually rise again.
<k>
<p>
Fire and explosions will put
a permanent end to it
getting back up, though.
<k>
<p>
Its HP is high, so it's hard
to take it down.
<k>
<p>
Like any other Bones, it
sometimes builds friends if
it feels outnumbered.
<k>
<p>
It's a pretty tough enemy.
<wait 250>
You better take it and its
buddies out all at once.
<k> menu_enemy_045 Max HP: 20  Attack: 5
Defense: 2
It's the baddest of the Bones
bunch, so its HP is really
high. When its HP gets down
to 0, it might rise again. btl_hlp_bunbaba That's Gloomtail.
<wait 250>
I think he's Hooktail's brother.
<wait 250>
I see the family resemblance...
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 80, Attack is 8,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
He'll bite or stomp you, and
<wait 250>
he may also breathe poison
on you.<wait 250> Great.
<k>
<p>
When his HP gets low, he may
throw in some other attacks,
as well. <wait 250>Wouldn't surprise me.
<k>
<p>
Especially watch out for his
megabreath move, 'cause the
word is, it's GNARLY!
<k>
<p>
He also stores power for some
attacks, so use Vivian to hide
to avoid those.
<k> menu_enemy_196 Max HP: 80  Attack: 8
Defense: 2
Hooktail's brother. He's a big,
dark, poison-spewing baddie.
Watch out for his famous
megabreath attack! btl_hlp_majyorin2 That's Beldam.
<wait 250>
She's the leader of the
Shadow Sirens.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 30, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
Her special move is a blizzard
blast.<wait 250> If it hits you, you'll
totally freeze.
<k>
<p>
She has lots of other tricks
up her sleeves, too.
<k>
<p>
I wonder what that plan was
that she mentioned?<wait 250> What do
you think they're up to?
<k> menu_enemy_107 Max HP: 30  Attack: 5
Defense: 0
Leader of the three Shadow
Sirens. She'll throw all
sorts of magic at you and
has a very unpleasant
disposition. btl_hlp_maririn2 That's Marilyn.
<wait 250>
She's Beldam's sister, another
one of the Shadow Sirens.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 40, Attack is 7,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
She'll attack you directly
or use lightning.
<k>
<p>
She also saves up energy for
a big attack sometimes.
<k>
<p>
So long as you avoid the
brunt of her attacks, she
shouldn't be too tough...
<k> menu_enemy_111 Max HP: 40  Attack: 7
Defense: 0
Beldam's sister, and therefore
one of the Shadow Sirens.
Her Attack is high, so take
her out first. btl_hlp_ranperu_las That's Doopliss.
<wait 250>
He's a shapeshifter, and even
turned into you once, Mario!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 40, Attack is 6,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
He may turn into one of us
and attack.<wait 250> When he does,
he'll have our abilities!
<k>
<p>
Hey, how do you think he
became one of the Shadow
Sirens? <wait 250>Isn't that...weird?
<k>
<p>
How do you think he stands
Beldam's abuse?<wait 250> You think
he's all right in the head?
<k> menu_enemy_125 Max HP: 40  Attack: 6
Defense: 0
A fiend who takes the shapes
of Mario and friends, then
attacks. Currently a member
of the Shadow Sirens. btl_hlp_koopa That's Bowser, genius.
<wait 250>
You've only fought this guy
like, a bazillion times.
<k>
<p>
He'll keep kidnapping Peach,
and you'll keep fighting him,
until the end of time, I think.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 70, Attack is 7,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
In addition to his fire breath,
he jumps on you and bites.
<k>
<p>
If you get jumped on, you'll
be unable to use a command
for a little while.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and his bite sometimes
poisons you as well.
<k>
<p>
I don't know what Bowser's
doing here, but we gotta
defeat him quick!
<k> menu_enemy_149 Max HP: 70  Attack: 7
Defense: 2
Mario's sworn enemy. He's a
big galoot who's come to
swipe Peach and the Crystal
Stars. btl_hlp_kamec_obaba That's Kammy Koopa.
<wait 250>
She's an evil old witch who's
always helping Bowser out.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 50, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
She uses magic to raise her
Attack and Defense or get
electrified or invisible.
<k>
<p>
When her HP gets low, she
may also use magic to
restore HP.
<k>
<p>
Her magic is totally annoying,
so take her out before you
focus on Bowser.
<k>
<p>
Still, you gotta feel for her,
having to hang out with
Bowser all the time...
<k>
<p>
Or do you think Bowser has
a harder time enduring her?
<k> menu_enemy_150 Max HP: 50  Attack: 5
Defense: 0
An old witch who's always
with Bowser. She's a nasty,
magic-using crone, but you
should still respect your
elders! Remember that! btl_hlp_batsugalf That's Grodus!
<wait 250>
He's the head of the X-Nauts
who kidnapped Peach.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 50, Attack is 7,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
But...when he has Grodus Xs
surrounding him, his Defense
will go up by that number.
<k>
<p>
He may also use electricity,
fire, and time-stopping magic.
<wait 250>
That doesn't sound good!
<k>
<p>
Still, he's a totally weird
guy. <wait 250>Why's he so intense and
serious all the time?
<k>
<p>
I guess we don't have time
to worry about that.<wait 300> Let's
beat him and find Peach!
<k> menu_enemy_151 Max HP: 50  Attack: 7
Defense: 1
The nasty creature that
kidnapped Peach. He's into
world domination. Some
hobby, huh? btl_hlp_batsu_satellite That's a Grodus X.
<wait 250>
It protects Grodus.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 3, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
This guy is no problem on its
own, but Grodus's Defense
goes up for each of them.
<k>
<p>
When he has four surrounding
him, we won't be able to
damage him at all.
<k>
<p>
So let's dish out some hurt
to them while we pound on
Grodus.<wait 250> Got it?
<k> menu_enemy_152 Max HP: 3  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
An annoying magical
protector of Grodus.
When he has four of these,
he's invincible! btl_hlp_shadowqueen1 Omigosh, what happened?
<wait 250>
I can't believe Peach got
possessed!<wait 250> That's AWFUL!
<k>
<p>
Now she's...the Shadow Queen.
<wait 250>
The demon that destroyed
this town 1,000 years ago.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 150, Attack is 7,
and Defense is 0.<wait 300> She'll
unleash big lightning attacks.
<k>
<p>
She'll also use magic to
raise Attack and Defense, or
to absorb HP...
<k>
<p>
She might even try to drag
us into the darkness...
<k>
<p>
I don't feel good about
attacking Peach, but we
have to do SOMETHING!
<k>
<p>
Don't think of it as Peach!
<wait 300>
We just have to fight to the
end! <wait 250>C'MON!!!

Wow, she's scary...but we
gotta hold our ground!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 150, Attack is 7,
and Defense is 1.
<k>
<p>
She'll use lightning magic and
boost her own Attack and
Defense power.
<k>
<p>
And, if she uses her breath
on us, we could be poisoned,
confused, or lose power-ups!
<k>
<p>
But...the worst is when she
saves energy for a big
attack! That...<wait 250>is...<wait 250>GNARLY!
<k>
<p>
We'd do best to just avoid it
by hiding in the shadows
with Vivian, I think.
<k>
<p>
Boy, and not only is her body
scary, but her hands are
pretty mean, as well.
<k>
<p>
She has several attack
patterns, so watch closely to
see what's coming!
<k>
<p><dynamic 3>
Now, Mario! <wait 250>Let's do it!
<wait 250>
This is it, our final battle!
<wait 250>
Let's give it all we've got!
<k> menu_enemy_154 Max HP: 150  Attack: 7
Defense: 1
The demon who possessed
Peach. She tried to cast the
world into darkness, but
Mario whipped her but good.
And Peach is back to normal,
thank goodness! btl_hlp_yami_kuriboo That's a Gloomba.
<wait 250>
It likes dark, damp places.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
It's stronger than a normal
Goomba, so be careful.
<k>
<p>
That's not a healthy color for
a Goomba, but it doesn't
mean it's sick or anything.
<k>
<p>
So don't show any mercy!
<k> menu_enemy_026 Max HP: 7  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
A Goomba that likes dark,
damp places. It must look
like that because it lives
belowground! btl_hlp_yami_patakuri That's a Paragloomba.
<wait 250>
It's a Gloomba with wings.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 3,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
It's like a stronger version
of a Parakoopa.<wait 250> And maybe
that's all there is to it.
<k>
<p>
I wonder if living down here
ever makes its wings moldy?
<k>
<p><dynamic 3>
EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYUCK!
</dynamic><wait 250>
It's too gross to even think
about! <wait 250>Bleck!
<k> menu_enemy_028 Max HP: 7  Attack: 3
Defense: 0
A Gloomba with wings that
may or may not get moldy. btl_hlp_yami_togekuri That's a Spiky Gloomba.
<wait 250>
It's a Spiky Goomba that
likes dark places.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 7, Attack is 4, and
Defense is 0.<wait 300> Its Attack is
pretty high, huh?
<k>
<p>
I'm sure you know this, but
try not to jump on the spike.
<k>
<p>
I wonder if I'd look like
that if I stayed down here
long enough?
<k>
<p>
<wait 300>
...I'd rather not think about
that. <wait 250>Are there tanning
salons in Rogueport?
<k> menu_enemy_027 Max HP: 7  Attack: 4
Defense: 0
A Gloomba with a painful-
looking spike that likes
damp places. btl_hlp_yami_noko That's a Dark Koopa.
<wait 250>
It lives in dark places that
the light never reaches.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
It's a bit tougher than a
regular Koopa, so you won't
be able to beat it easily.
<k>
<p>
But, it DOES have the same
weakness as a regular Koopa.
<wait 250>
Flip it over and it's helpless.
<k>
<p>
Why do you think it needs
sunglasses down here,
anyway? <wait 250>What's the point?
<k> menu_enemy_029 Max HP: 8  Attack: 4
Defense: 2
A Koopa that prefers dark
places. It has a very hard
shell, but you can flip it
by jumping on it. btl_hlp_yami_pata This is a Dark Paratroopa.
<wait 250>
It lives in dark, damp places.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
It's strong, but otherwise
just like other Paratroopas.
<k>
<p>
It's airborne, so try to
ground it first.
<k> menu_enemy_030 Max HP: 8  Attack: 4
Defense: 2
A Paratroopa that lives
in dark, damp places. It
has a very hard shell, but
you can flip it over by
jumping on it. btl_hlp_badge_borodo That's a Badge Bandit.
<wait 250>
He's a Bandit who'll go after
your badges. <wait 250>That jerk!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 12, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 0.<wait 250> He has
high Attack power and HP.
<k>
<p>
He sometimes steals a badge
when he tackles you, so use
your Guard carefully.
<k>
<p>
And even if he gets one,
keep your cool, OK?
<k>
<p>
If he runs from the battle,
you can always find him
and reengage him.
<k> menu_enemy_078 Max HP: 12  Attack: 5
Defense: 0
A Bandit who steals badges.
His HP and Attack are high.
Use your Guard well to keep
your badges! btl_hlp_hyper_jyugem That's a Dark Lakitu.
<wait 250>
It rides a rain cloud.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 13, Attack is 5,
and Defense is 0.<wait 250> It attacks
by throwing pipes at you.
<k>
<p>
If it's holding up a pipe
when you jump on it, you'll
get hurt.
<k>
<p>
And sometimes the pipes it
throws turn into Sky-Blue
Spinies. <wait 250>Whoa!
<k>
<p>
If you only attack the
Spinies, you'll never win,
so go after the Dark Lakitu!
<k> menu_enemy_186 Max HP: 13  Attack: 5
Defense is 0.
A Lakitu on a dark cloud.
It throws pipes at you
that sometimes turn into
Sky-Blue Spinies. btl_hlp_hyper_togezo That's a Sky-Blue Spiny.
<wait 250>
It appeared from a pipe
thrown by the Dark Lakitu.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 6, Attack is 6,
and Defense is 4.<wait 250> It'll
totally charge at you!
<k>
<p>
Sometimes it balls up to
defend and store energy for
an attack.
<k>
<p>
If you can, beat it and any
buddies it may have with a
special attack.
<k> menu_enemy_173 Max HP: 6  Attack: 6
Defense: 4
Spawned from a pipe thrown
by Dark Lakitu, it will
charge at you. When it's
balled up, your attacks
won't work. btl_hlp_mahorn That's a Wizzerd.
<wait 250>
It's a part-machine, part-
organic, centuries-old thing.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Attack is 6,
and Defense is 3.
<k>
<p>
It uses magic to attack,
heal, and alter your
condition, so stay on guard.
<k>
<p>
Its Defense is high, but we
can totally take this thing!
<k> menu_enemy_070 Max HP: 10  Attack: 6
Defense: 3
A part-machine, part-organic
creature who uses different
kinds of magic. It looks
to be the best tickler of
all time. btl_hlp_pakkun_flower That's a Piranha Plant.
<wait 250>
In fact, I think this is the
strongest type of them all.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 15, Attack is 9
and Defense is 0.<wait 250> Its Attack
power is absurdly high...
<k>
<p>
It may look like a normal
Piranha Plant, but don't be
fooled! <wait 250>It's super-tough!
<k>
<p>
If we get beaten by a flower,
we'll never hear the end of
it, know what I mean?
<k> menu_enemy_014 Max HP: 15  Attack: 9
Defense: 0
The strongest of the Piranha
Plants. It likes to live...
in pipes. btl_hlp_hennya That's a Spunia.
<wait 250>
Its body is made up of
springy discs.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 12, Attack is 7,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
It may not look like much,
but it's pretty tough.
<k>
<p>
It won't come at you with
anything too weird, so just
hang in there, OK?
<k> menu_enemy_022 Max HP: 12  Attack: 7
Defense: 2
A creature with a body made
up of springy discs. It may
not look like much, but it's
pretty tough. btl_hlp_churantalar That's an Arantula.
<wait 250>
It's a spiderlike creature
that lives deep underground.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 16, Attack is 7,
and Defense is 0.<wait 250> Yeah...
<wait 250>
It's pretty tough.
<k>
<p>
It'll spit web-wads at you.
<wait 300>
Sometimes it even attacks
several times in a row.
<k>
<p>
That coloring freaks me out.
<wait 250>
...I'm kinda scared of spiders.
<wait 250>
So let's do this quickly!!
<k> menu_enemy_176 Max HP: 16  Attack: 7
Defense: 0
A spiderlike creature that
lives deep underground
and spits web-wads. Its
coloring is intimidating,
but don't worry; it's not
poisonous. btl_hlp_yamitogedaruma That's a Dark Bristle.
<wait 250>
It's an ancient creature made
of rock.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 8, Attack is 8,
and Defense is 4.
<k>
<p>
You can't jump on it because
of its spikes, and you can't
approach due to its spears.
<k>
<p>
AND its Defense is high.
<k>
<p>
You'd better take it out
with special attacks or items.
<k> menu_enemy_174 Max HP: 8 Attack: 8
Defense: 4
An ancient creature made
of rock. Its Defense is high.
You can't jump on it because
of its spikes, and you can't
get close to it because of
its spears. btl_hlp_dokugassun That's a Poison Puff.
<wait 250>
Basically just a puff of
poisonous air.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 15, Attack is 8,
and Defense is 0.<wait 250> Its
poison-gas attack is 10!
<k>
<p>
These things charge you, but
they also save up toxins and
poison you with them. <wait 250>Scum!
<k>
<p>
Plus, you can't touch them
when they're saving up toxins
or you'll get hurt. <wait 250>Lame!
<k> menu_enemy_013 Max HP: 15  Attack: 8
Defense: 0
A poisonous cloud creature.
It'll charge you or try to
poison you, and if you touch
it while it's storing poison,
you'll get hurt. btl_hlp_basabasa_green That's a Swampire.
<wait 250>
It's a feared health-sucker
that hides in the darkness.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 20, Attack is 6,
and Defense is 0.
<k>
<p>
It sucks health from its prey
to add to its own HP.
<k>
<p>
And that...<wait 100>totally grosses me
out like you wouldn't believe.
<k>
<p>
If you let it feast on you,
its HP will get really high.
<k>
<p>
Focus your attacks on it!
<k> menu_enemy_177 Max HP: 20  Attack: 6
Defense: 0
A feared health-sucking bat
that lives in the darkness.
It steals your HP to add to
its own. btl_hlp_giant_bomb That's a Bob-ulk.
<wait 250>
That's...<wait 250>easily the biggest
Bob-omb I've ever seen!
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 10, Attack is 4,
and Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
It won't attack, but once its
fuse is lit, it'll explode
after a while.
<k>
<p>
So the problem is...how to
beat it before it goes off.
<k>
<p>
I mean, its bomb attack has
a power of 16!<wait 250> That's no joke.
<wait 250>
Seriously, watch out for that.
<k>
<p>
Just go all out to beat it.
<wait 250>
Pull out all the stops.
<k>
<p>
Or you could just set it off
early with fire or explosions.
<wait 250>
Your call.
<k> menu_enemy_182 Max HP: 10  Attack: 4
Defense: 2
A really, really big Bob-omb
that explodes after 4 turns.
Take it out before then or
you'll be peeling your lips
off the ceiling! btl_hlp_mahorn_custom That's an Elite Wizzerd.
<wait 250>
This is the top of the heap
for half-machine organisms.
<k>
<p>
Max HP is 12, Attack is 8,
and Defense is 5.
<k>
<p>
You can probably guess this,
but it uses various magic
moves in battle.
<k>
<p>
And, if it's alone, it'll create
illusions of itself.
<k>
<p>
It has no real weakness.
<k>
<p>
So just use whatever you've
got to beat it, OK?
<wait 250>
Let's go, Mario!!
<k> menu_enemy_183 Max HP: 12  Attack: 8
Defense: 5
The top of the heap for
half-machine organisms.
It uses various magic moves,
and if it's alone, it'll
create illusions of itself. btl_hlp_mahorn_custom_bunshin That's an Elite Wizzerd
illusion.<wait 250> There's no point in
attacking it.
<k>
<p>
The real Elite Wizzerd has a
Max HP of 12, an Attack of 8,
and a Defense of 5.
<k>
<p>
If you attack the real one,
the illusions will vanish.
<wait 250>
So find the real one!
<k> btl_hlp_zonbaba That's Bonetail.
<wait 250>
He's the oldest brother of
Hooktail.
<k>
<p>
...So old he's just bones,
in fact.<wait 250> Wow.<wait 250> Now THAT'S old.
<k>
<p>
His body's Max HP is 200,
his Attack is 8, and his
Defense is 2.
<k>
<p>
He has various breaths that
might confuse us or put us
to sleep.
<k>
<p>
When his HP gets low, he'll
recover...<wait 100>or reanimate, as the
case may be.
<k>
<p>
He's probably stronger than
the last boss, seriously!
<wait 300>
Let's do this right!
<k> menu_enemy_195 Max HP: 200  Attack: 8
Defense: 2
The oldest brother of
Hooktail. He's just bones
now. He's incredibly tough...
Maybe even the toughest? btl_hlp_kanbu1 0????0?

What a co-inky-dink!
<k> gor_luigi_01 Eh? <wait 250>Who, me?
<k>
<p>
Well, Bro, I'm on an adventure.
<wait 250>
I have to rescue Princess
Eclair of the Waffle Kingdom.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, it's a bad scene, all
right. <wait 250>She's been kidnapped
by the evil Chestnut King.
<k> gor_luigi_01_1 Eh? <wait 250>Who, me?
<k>
<p>
Well, I was in the area, so
I thought I'd drop by this inn.
<wait 250>
One thing led to another...
<k> gor_luigi_02 If you gotta know, I met with
some Waffle Kingdom cabinet
members the other day.
<k>
<p>
It was pretty crazy, Bro.
<wait 250>
Wanna hear what happened?
<wait 250>
It's a pretty long story...
<o> gor_luigi_03 Well, I went to Rumblebump
Volcano and got myself a
Marvelous Compass piece!
<k>
<p>
It was an incredible quest!<wait 250> 
There was danger, and all
sorts of adventuring!
<k>
<p>
It was pretty nutso, Bro.
<wait 250>
Wanna hear what happened?
<wait 250>
It's a pretty long story...
<o> gor_luigi_04 Well, I got my second piece of
the Marvelous Compass at
Plumpbelly Village recently!
<k>
<p>
Hoo, boy! <wait 250>I really got my
hands dirty on that one,
I'll tell you what!
<k>
<p>
It was pretty wild, Bro.
<wait 250>
Wanna hear what happened?
<wait 250>
It's a pretty long story...
<o> gor_luigi_05 Well, I headed to Circuit
Break Island and got me
a Marvelous Compass piece!
<k>
<p>
You wouldn't believe it,
Bro!<wait 250> Talk about thrills,
chills, and spills!
<k>
<p>
It was pretty nuts, Bro.
<wait 250>
Wanna hear what happened?
<wait 250>
It's a pretty long story...
<o> gor_luigi_06 Well, I got another piece of
that Marvelous Compass!<wait 250> At
Jazzafrazz Town, this time.
<k>
<p>
Bro, I'm telling you, I turned
adventuring into an art form
on THAT little quest!<wait 250> Hoo!
<k>
<p>
It was pretty nutty, Bro.
<wait 250>
Wanna hear what happened?
<wait 250>
It's a pretty long story...
<o> gor_luigi_07 Well, guess what I found
in Rapturous Ruins, Bro? <wait 400>Yup!
<wait 250>
A Marvelous Compass piece!
<k>
<p>
This part of my adventure
was actually sort of sad,
if you wanna know the truth.
<k>
<p>
It was pretty insane, Bro.
<wait 250>
Wanna hear what happened?
<wait 250>
It's a pretty long story...
<o> gor_luigi_08 Let's see, adventures...
<wait 250>
Oh, of course!<wait 250> Me, I'm done
questing for now.
<k>
<p>
Yup!<wait 250> I scaled Hatesong Tower
the other day and rescued
the fair Princess Eclair!
<k>
<p>
That's one adventure I'm
never gonna forget.<wait 250> Nope,
it was just tooooo exciting!
<k>
<p>
It was just bonkers, Bro.
<wait 250>
Wanna hear what happened?
<wait 250>
It's a pretty long story...
<o> gor_luigi_09 I've been catching a breather
here, you know, reflecting
back on all my adventures.
<k>
<p>
It's been a long road, Bro.<wait 250> 
Wanna hear what happened?
<wait 250>
It's a pretty long story...
<o> gor_luigi_11 <p>
Hey, sounds good to me!<wait 250> 
Which part of my story
you wanna hear, Bro?
<k> gor_luigi_12 <p>
Oh, really?<wait 250> Your loss, Bro.
<wait 250>
Maybe I'll tell you about
it some other time, huh?
<k> gor_luigi_13 If you wanna hear what I've
been up to, just come find
me, OK?<wait 250> I'll be around.
<k> gor_luigi_talk_0000 <!STG1_17,Waffle Kingdom Letter>
Well, like I said, it's a really
long story, but here goes...
<k>
<p>
My big brother--that's you,
Bro--got a letter from
Princess Peach and took off.
<k>
<p>
Left behind as usual, I was
cooking a snack at home
when another letter arrived.
<k>
<p>
We don't get so much mail,
so I was thinking: "Huh?"
<wait 250>
This is what the letter said:
<k>
<p>
"Sirs! <wait 250>My name is Crepe.<wait 250> I am
a cabinet minister in the
far-off Waffle Kingdom.
<k>
<p>
"Our land has been attacked
by the Chestnut King, who
took our Princess Eclair.
<k>
<p>
"I ask, nay, BEG for your
assistance! <wait 250>The Waffle
Kingdom needs your skills.
<k>
<p>
"I humbly request your
prompt response, sirs.<wait 250> 
Sincerely, Crepe"
<k>
<p>
...Well, I don't remember it
exactly, but I think it went
something like that.
<k>
<p>
With Mario--that's you,
Bro--gone, it fell to me to
answer this plea!
<k>
<p>
Hesitating only a teensy
bit, I headed to the Waffle
Kingdom to investigate.
<k>
<p>
Oh, no, first I wrote a
note to myself about what
I was cooking.<wait 400> Then I left.
<k>
<p>
Once I reached the Waffle
Kingdom, I met Minister
Crepe, who filled me in.
<k>
<p>
The Chestnut King had
kidnapped Princess
Eclair and vanished.
<k>
<p>
Apparently, though, some
oracle said a Marvelous
Compass could locate her.
<k>
<p>
This Marvelous Compass
had been broken into seven
parts by an ancient curse...
<k>
<p>
...and those parts had been
scattered across the land.
<wait 250>
Can you believe it, Bro?
<k>
<p>
Each part of the Marvelous
Compass was said to
point to the next.
<k>
<p>
And since one of the parts
was embedded in the tiara
worn by the princess...
<k>
<p>
I surmised that once I
collected all the parts, I'd
find her!<wait 250> Smart, huh?
<k>
<p>
The minister gave me the
compass base spoken
of in Waffler fables...
<k>
<p>
When it activated, the
entire thing lit right up,
indicating the deep south...
<k>
<p>
It was pointing me toward
Rumblebump Volcano on
the Pudding Continent!
<k>
<p>
So yeah, here I am!<wait 250> I'm
sailing out of Rogueport
for Rumblebump Volcano.
<k>
<p>
It's probably gonna be
pretty dangerous, but...
<wait 250>
I gotta rescue that princess!
<k>
 gor_luigi_talk_0001 <!STG2_25,Rumblebump Volcano>
Well, like I said, it's a really
long story, but here goes...
<k>
<p>
As soon as my ship docked
on the Pudding Continent,
I set out for the volcano.
<k>
<p>
To reach my destination, I
spent several days fording
through dense jungle...
<k>
<p>
Scary beasts were all over!
<wait 250>
More than once I thought
I was done for, Bro!
<k>
<p>
I may have screamed a bit.
<wait 250>
To scare them off, you know.
<wait 250>
But as fate would have it...
<k>
<p>
A Blooper named Blooey
heard me shrieking and
found me in this one town.
<k>
<p>
Blooey was on a journey of
his own, but he joined me
after hearing my tale.
<k>
<p>
Now, Blooey's a madman.
<wait 250>
Back in his hometown, they
call him "White Torpedo"!
<k>
<p>
Yeah, he's a tough guy.
<wait 250>
Anyway, he helped me fight
to Rumblebump Volcano.
<k>
<p>
This place was all about
bubbling lava pools and heat
that'd make the sun sweat.
<k>
<p>
AND, the place was lousy
with evil traps designed to
protect the compass piece.
<k>
<p>
The scariest one of all was
this gigantic, 100-foot-tall
statue that stomped around.
<k>
<p>
Now, the weakness of this
giant statue, Bro, was a red
gem on its forehead...
<k>
<p>
Now, I can jump high, but
not high enough to reach
this thing by a long shot.
<k>
<p>
So I came up with this plan
for Blooey to hit that weak
spot! <wait 250>"All you, man!" I said!
<k>
<p>
I waited for a pause in
the statue's movements
and hucked Blooey up there!
<k>
<p>
And bull's-eye! <wait 250>The White
Torpedo saved the day!
<wait 250>
That jewel got whacked!
<k>
<p>
It was a critical hit, and
that stone statue toppled
and crumbled into pieces!
<k>
<p>
Once that was done, it was
an easy stroll to the room
where the treasure was.
<k>
<p>
Unfortunately, Princess
Eclair was nowhere to
be found...
<k>
<p>
But I got another piece of
the Marvelous Compass,
and put it in the base...
<k>
<p>
Now the compass pointed
west, to Plumpbelly Village
on the Strudel Continent.
<k>
<p>
So I set sails once again
and came back here to
Rogueport to recharge.
<k>
<p>
That's what happened to
me lately, but I'll be
heading back out soon...
<k>
 gor_luigi_talk_0002 <!STG3_32,Plumpbelly Village>
Well, like I said, it's a really
long story, but here goes...
<k>
<p>
Once we made landfall on
the Strudel Continent, we
made for Plumpbelly Village.
<k>
<p>
Once we got there, though,
we immediately noticed
that something was wrong.
<k>
<p>
We learned from the mayor
that the town was ruled by a
giant snake named Hizza!
<k>
<p>
He said his own daughter
was gonna be offered up as a
sacrifice to this beast, too!
<k>
<p>
So, of course, being heroic,
I offered myself up to go in
her stead! <wait 250>Brave, huh?
<k>
<p>
Now, the custom was for
sacrifices to be dressed as
brides, so I got all dolled up...
<k>
<p>
I was one hot sacrifice, Bro.
<wait 250>
I looked so good, I fooled our
foes and got in Hizza's lair.
<k>
<p>
It was kind of rough fighting
in that gown, but I managed.
<wait 250>
Chiffon really chafes, Bro!
<k>
<p>
I finally found Hizza...and the
snake had a second head on
its tail! <wait 250>Talk about scary!
<k>
<p>
I fainted real quick, but
when I came to, I managed
to distract both heads...
<k>
<p>
It reared up, fangs bared to
attack, and at that moment,
I deftly lunged left!
<k>
<p>
His gaping mouths smashed
into one another...and he
vanished in a cloud of smoke!
<k>
<p>
A shining plate fell down on
the spot where Hizza's body
had been coiled...
<k>
<p>
Yes!<wait 250> Another compass piece!
<wait 250>
I set it, and it pointed east,
to Circuit Break Island!
<k>
<p>
Just as I was about to leave
town, the mayor asked me to
stay and marry his daughter.
<k>
<p>
I thought about it--she was
sorta cute--but we ended up
sneaking off the next morning.
<k>
<p>
I mean, I still have to save
Princess Eclair from the
Chestnut King!
<k>
<p>
And...when the Marvelous
Compass activated this time,
I heard somebody's voice.
<k>
<p>
It was so beautiful, Bro...
<wait 250>
I'm certain it was Princess
Eclair's voice!
<k>
<p>
My heart began to race!
<wait 250>
That's when I realized it:
<wait 250>
Princess Eclair...<wait 250> I think I...
<k>
<p>
Oh! <wait 250>I kinda zoned out there.
<wait 250>
Umm... <wait 250>So, yeah.<wait 250> We set sail
again after ditching town...
<k>
<p>
And somehow we managed to
get back here to Rogueport.
<wait 250>
And here I am!
<k>
 gor_luigi_talk_0003 <!STG4_15_05,Circuit Break Island>
Well, like I said, it's a really
long story, but here goes...
<k>
<p>
Just as our boat arrived at
Circuit Break Island, we
heard this incredible racket!
<k>
<p>
We soon found out that
they hold kart races almost
every day on the island.
<k>
<p>
Whoever takes first place in
the race gets to rule the
island as king for that day.
<k>
<p>
Just as we got to the race-
track, they were holding the
awards ceremony...
<k>
<p>
I couldn't believe my eyes!
<wait 250>
Right there, on the trophy
they give to the winner...
<k>
<p>
It was another piece of the
Marvelous Compass!<wait 250> I almost
passed dead away!
<k>
<p>
I decided right then and
there that the only thing to
do was enter the next race.
<k>
<p>
I mean, I've driven in kart
races before, so I thought I'd
be OK. <wait 250>Boy, was I wrong.
<k>
<p>
The karts were supercharged
machines that could send you
airborne with their exhaust!
<k>
<p>
These vehicles were armed
with missiles and bazookas...
<wait 250>
It was "anything goes," Bro!
<k>
<p>
Of course, I wanted to get
right out of there, pronto!
<wait 250>
These drivers were crazed!
<k>
<p>
But I worked up my courage
and signed up anyway.<wait 250> And
my race day finally came...
<k>
<p>
I got one of the best karts:
the Big Green 01! <wait 250>I took my
position at the start line...
<k>
<p>
The light went green, I
stomped the accelerator...
<wait 250>
and something bad happened.
<k>
<p>
I was in reverse!<wait 250> The Big
Green 01 went rocketing
backwards with me yelling...
<k>
<p>
I crashed into the wall
behind me hard enough
to cut me off midscream.
<k>
<p>
In one fell swoop I dropped
into last place and wrecked
my racing machine...
<k>
<p>
But it wasn't all bad news:
all the other karts crashed
because of my maneuver...
<k>
<p>
Once I got in gear and took
off, I was the only car left!
<wait 250>
I won by a country mile, Bro!
<k>
<p>
I took the piece off of my
trophy and added it to the
Marvelous Compass...
<k>
<p>
The compass came to life
and pointed me toward
Jazzafrazz Town in the east!
<k>
<p>
Then I heard that voice!
<wait 250>
Princess Eclair's voice
echoed in my ears again!
<k>
<p>
Oh, my princess! <wait 250>Random
words would form poetry
if spoken by your voice!
<k>
<p>
I will most definitely
save you! <wait 250>Just wait for
me! <wait 250>Princess Eclair!!!
<k>
<p>
Oh! <wait 100>Sorry about that, Bro...
<wait 250>
Umm... <wait 250>So, after that, I got
back on my boat...
<k>
<p>
And came back here to
Rogueport.<wait 250> And that's what's
been up with me.
<k> gor_luigi_talk_0004 <!STG5_43,Jazzafrazz Town>
Well, like I said, it's a really
long story, but here goes...
<k>
<p>
As soon as we hit Jazzafrazz
Town, we were overcome by
the glitz and the glamour.
<k>
<p>
It's a very lively place, Bro.
<wait 250>
Tons of Dayzees live there,
and they're always smiling!
<k>
<p>
While looking for the piece
of compass, I met a hip
Dayzee named Hayzee.
<k>
<p>
Hayzee was a producer, and
he was looking for actors
to go on stage with him.
<k>
<p>
I told him we couldn't, since
we were looking for the
compass part, you know.
<k>
<p>
But Hayzee said we could
WIN the compass part in
the upcoming Drama Slam!
<k>
<p>
He said the so-called
Dramalama Plaque might,
in fact, be one of the parts!
<k>
<p>
Well, we just had to give it
a try, so we rehearsed with
the cast and hit the stage!
<k>
<p>
Our musical was called
"The Mystery of the Fiery
Hat of Social Awareness."
<k>
<p>
The script was great, but
I got really hosed, Bro...
<wait 250>
My "role"...<wait 250> My "part"...
<k>
<p>
...Was grass! <wait 400>I played grass
by the side of the road!
<wait 250>
Grass, Bro!<wait 250> Grass!
<k>
<p>
I just sprawled out on the
ground and had to be silent.
<wait 250>
Everyone but me had lines...
<k>
<p>
I don't care if I was wearing
green!<wait 250> Who casts someone
based on that?<wait 250> It was awful!
<k>
<p>
In the end, our musical was
the talk of the town, and we
won the Drama Slam.
<k>
<p>
I got the compass part I was
after, but even that didn't
make me very happy.
<k>
<p>
The huge after-party just
bummed me out more, so I
snuck out the back door.
<k>
<p>
But WOW! <wait 250>Outside were
tons of fans!<wait 250> MY fans!<wait 250> Fans
of grass! <wait 250>They swarmed me!
<k>
<p>
I just couldn't believe it!
<wait 250>
Imagine!<wait 250> Cheering for
grass! <wait 250>I was ecstatic, Bro!
<k>
<p>
After that I added the piece
to the Marvelous Compass,
which pointed north.
<k>
<p>
It pointed to the Rapturous
Ruins in Grimble Forest.
<wait 250>
Then... <wait 250>The voice again...
<k>
<p>
Oh, my cherished Princess
Eclair! <wait 250>How you soothe me!
<wait 250>
I would be grass for you...
<k>
<p>
I will find you!<wait 250> I will reach
you! <wait 250>I will stand by your
side and be your Luigi!
<k>
<p>
Wow. <wait 250>Sorry about that, Bro.
<wait 250>
Umm... <wait 100>So, yeah, anyway...
<wait 250>
Then I got back on my boat.
<k>
<p>
I came back to Rogueport,
and here I am, another leg
of my adventure completed!
<k>
 gor_luigi_talk_0005 <!STG6_54,Rapturous Ruins>
Well, like I said, it's a really
long story, but here goes...
<k>
<p>
After journeying deep into
the Grimble Forest, I found
the domed Rapturous Ruins.
<k>
<p>
Inside, everything was pure
white.<wait 250> You couldn't tell where
the floor became walls...
<k>
<p>
Proceeding dead ahead, I
found myself in a chamber
where a young boy sat.
<k>
<p>
As I approached the boy,
someone named Screamy
appeared out of nowhere!
<k>
<p>
Screamy said the boy's name
was Cranberry, and that he'd
wake for a child of fate.
<k>
<p>
That didn't make any sense
to me, so I started searching
quietly for the compass piece.
<k>
<p>
But then it happened, Bro:
<wait 100>
I got a tiny tickle in my nose,
and I let out a huge sneeze!
<k>
<p>
Well, Cranberry must've
heard it, 'cause he opened
his eyes right up!
<k>
<p>
He looked at me and smiled.
<wait 250>
And all of a sudden I could
understand his language!
<k>
<p>
Can you believe it? <wait 250>I learned
that the boy was the last of
an ancient race, the Luffs...
<k>
<p>
He had been there guarding
the Marvelous Compass piece
for the last thousand years!
<k>
<p>
He told me that the compass
is an item with the power to
see into the future...
<k>
<p>
The ancient Luff empire used
the power of the compass to
rule much of the world.
<k>
<p>
Because of their greed, they
were cursed by the compass,
and their empire collapsed.
<k>
<p>
To prevent a repeat of their
fate, Cranberry broke the
compass into seven parts.
<k>
<p>
He hid six and kept one,
putting himself to sleep until
a worthy hero woke him.
<k>
<p>
I WAS that hero, Bro!<wait 250> He
gave it to me, and then he
and the ruins vanished...
<k>
<p>
When I added that piece to
the compass...
<k>
<p>
It pointed to the far north,
where dreaded Hatesong
Tower stands.
<k>
<p>
This time, I heard Princess
Eclair's voice more clearly
than ever before!
<k>
<p>
I will rescue the princess!
<wait 250>
I will be super!<wait 250> And then I'll...
<wait 250>
I'll... <wait 250>I'll...
<k>
<p>
Well, I'll figure the rest out
later. <wait 250>Anyway, I headed back
here to Rogueport after that.
<k>
<p>
I'm making my final
preparations for my final
battle now.
<k>
<p>
I'm a little nervous, Bro.
<wait 250>
But that's what I've been
up to, anyway!
<k>
 gor_luigi_talk_0006 <!STG7_20,Hatesong Tower>
Well, like I said, it's a really
long story, and this part is
just crazy, but here goes...
<k>
<p>
Hatesong Tower stands atop
a jagged, unclimbable cliff
beyond the northernmost sea.
<k>
<p>
The winds whistle down the
cliff, howling like banshees
singing songs of hate...
<k>
<p>
People say it's pretty much
the scariest place in the
world. <wait 250>And I had to go there.
<k>
<p>
Blocking out the bone-chilling
howls, I somehow managed
to reach the tower's door.
<k>
<p>
I was terrified, but thoughts
of Princess Eclair warmed
my heart and gave me power.
<k>
<p>
All of my companions felt the
same way.<wait 250> They were with
me to the bitter end.
<k>
<p>
The door to the tower swung
slowly open to reveal an
inconceivable darkness...
<k>
<p>
I tried to call out Princess
Eclair's name, but I couldn't
even breathe because...
<k>
<p>
As I strained my eyes in the
darkness, I saw the most
terrifying beast of all!
<k>
<p>
The Chestnut King himself
appeared before me!<wait 250> He was
monstrous and drooling!
<k>
<p>
Puddles of toxic goo dripped
from his mouth, melting the
very ground at our feet!
<k>
<p>
I couldn't stop shaking, but
I gritted my teeth and faced
the evil beast dead-on!
<k>
<p>
I dodged the king's fangs,
jumped onto his chest, and
gave him a hammer-whack!
<k>
<p>
My swing split the air and
crashed dead-center onto
the Chestnut King's skull!
<k>
<p>
Hope powered me up, Bro!
<wait 250>
I was going toe-to-toe with
the king, and I was loving it!
<k>
<p>
"This is it!" I thought!
<wait 250>
I can win this! <wait 250>I'll risk it all
on my next blow!
<k>
<p>
I gripped my hammer tight
and waited for my moment...
<wait 250>
The tension stung me...
<k>
<p>
SHHHHHWHAAAAACK!
<wait 400>
The ocean winds raged
against the tower windows!
<k>
<p>
With that sound as my call
to battle, I advanced with
no mercy in my heart!
<k>
<p>
And then..............................................
And then..............................................
..................................................................
<k>
<p>
..................................................................
..................................................................
..................................................................
<k>
<p>
I beat him.<wait 250> I defeated the
Chestnut King.
<k>
<p>
An even worse beast came
next, a nightmare thing...
<wait 250>
but I beat it, too.
<k>
<p>
...........................
<wait 250>
I rescued Princess Eclair.
<wait 250>
It was all over.
<k>
<p>
And then I came back to
Rogueport and had a light
lunch. <wait 250>And that's about it.
<k>
<p>
..........................
<k>
<p>
Huh? <wait 250>You think there's more
to the story than that?
<k>
<p>
Not at all. <wait 250>That's it.<wait 250> That's
the whole story of the quest
for Princess Eclair.<wait 250> The End.
<k>
<p>
But my adventures won't end
here, Bro...<wait 250> They'll never end...
<k> gor_luigi_talk_0007 <!STG8_END,Super Luigi Book>
Actually, know what? <wait 250>This guy
actually novelized my quest!
<wait 250>
He's been interviewing me.
<k>
<p>
He was actually interviewing
me here at the inn during
breaks from my adventure!
<k>
<p>
I didn't think anyone would
be interested in reading a
book about Luigi...
<k>
<p>
But "Super Luigi" came out
recently, and check this out,
Bro: <wait 250>here in Rogueport...
<k>
<p>
It's set a new record for
consecutive weeks at number
one on the best-seller list!!!
<k>
<p>
Oh ho ho ho ho ho ho ho!
<wait 250>
Hooray for Luigi, Bro!
<k>
<p>
I started reading it the other
day, but it's an encyclopedic
account in multiple volumes...
<k>
<p>
Excruciating detail, Bro.
<wait 250>
It's like a history book!
<wait 250>
...It seemed like one, anyway.
<k>
<p>
They've got it in the shop
here in Rogueport. <wait 250>How about
you snag a copy, Bro?

Have you ever 
experienced a
time when no
matter how hard
you tried, you
failed, and the
time you spent
felt wasted?
           -1- msg_luigi_book1_txt2 
If ever you feel
such pangs of
regret, try to
remember this
tale...the story
of a young man's
quest to save a
sweet princess.

           -3- msg_luigi_book1_txt4 
The day dawned
like any other,
but little did
Luigi know the
letter he was
about to receive
would forever
change his
destiny.
           -4- msg_luigi_book1_txt5 
"-Sir Luigi-
Danger besets
us on all sides,
and we beg your
help! The foul
Chestnut King
has stolen our
treasure: our
fair princess."
          -5- msg_luigi_book1_txt6 
The letter was
from Minister
Crepe of the
Waffle Kingdom,
a man aware of
Luigi's many
adventures. He
knew only Luigi
could save them.
           -6- msg_luigi_book1_txt7 
Charged with
this dire task,
Luigi wasted no
time curtailing
the heroic meal
he was making.
Then he packed
for his deadly
journey.
           -7- msg_luigi_book1_txt8 
Knowing that
his older, though
less talented,
brother was out
on a no-doubt
inconsequential
errand, Luigi
took a moment
to leave a note.
           -8- msg_luigi_book1_txt9 
"Mix a Keel
Mango with a
Peachy Peach
to whip up a
Fruit Parfait."
These cryptic
words were all
Luigi wrote
before leaving.
           -9- msg_luigi_book1_txt10 
Upon reaching
the Waffle
Kingdom, Luigi
was greeted by
pure misery, an
endless flow of
tears over the
kidnapping of
Princess Eclair.
           -10- msg_luigi_book1_txt11 
Arriving at the
castle, Luigi was
greeted by
Minister Crepe,
who carefully
handed him a
compass base
with only one
intact section.
           -11- msg_luigi_book1_txt12 
"Our land had a
second treasure:
the Marvelous
Compass. Find
its seven parts,
and find Eclair."
So it began...

           -1- msg_luigi_book2_txt2 
"It's a little
warm," Luigi
muttered, the
sweat dripping
from his brow
as he followed
the compass up
Rumblebump
Volcano's side.
           -2- msg_luigi_book2_txt3 
"Must...find...the
secret...grotto."
While Luigi had
guts to spare,
he did need a
guide, and he
found one in
Blooey, a Blooper
he met in town.
           -3- msg_luigi_book2_txt4 
Brave Blooey
joined Luigi and
instantly proved
to be invaluable.
With his aid,
Luigi bested a
savage statue
that protected
the treasure.
           -4- msg_luigi_book2_txt5 
That treasure
was none other
than a piece of
the Marvelous
Compass, a
piece that
pointed west
to Plumpbelly
Village.
           -5 msg_luigi_book2_txt6 
The second Luigi
saw Plumpbelly
Village, he knew
something was
amiss. All was
woe, and Luigi
soon learned the
reason why from
the mayor.
           -6- msg_luigi_book2_txt7 
The town was at
the mercy of a
sinister serpent,
who demanded
sacrificial lasses.
Burning with
indignation, Luigi
formed a team
of liberators.
           -7- msg_luigi_book2_txt8 
A fierce Bob-omb
warrior named
Jerry joined his
crew and chose,
not surprisingly,
to stick with
Luigi for the
duration of his
quest for Eclair.
           -8- msg_luigi_book2_txt9 
Fortified by his
allies, Luigi
strode on into
the lair of the
beast, a foul,
two-headed
snake. No time
to think! Luigi
sprang forth!
           -9- msg_luigi_book2_txt10 
Twin heads
snapped at his
heels, fangs
dripping venom!
Then, as one
mouth gaped
wide to swallow
Luigi, the other
crept behind...
           -10- msg_luigi_book2_txt11 
Our hero sensed
the treachery,
and feinted
before leaping!
The heads
collided, and the
beast ate itself!
The prize? A
compass piece!
          -11- msg_luigi_book2_txt12 
The villagers
begged their
savior to stay
with them, but
a grim-faced
Luigi pressed
bravely onward.

           -1- msg_luigi_book3_txt2 
Dauntless Luigi's
next test came
in the form of
a kart race on
Circuit Break
Island, where
he won both
the contest and
a compass piece.
           -2- msg_luigi_book3_txt3 
The race was
fraught with
danger, but Luigi
pressed through
adversity to win!
All viewers were
awed by Luigi's
revolutionary
racing style.
           -3- msg_luigi_book3_txt4 
The mechanic
who built Luigi's
racing machine,
a Buzzy Beetle
named Torque,
was so stunned
by Luigi's race
techniques that
he joined him.
           -4- msg_luigi_book3_txt5 
Reinvigorated,
Luigi set sail
for Jazzafrazz
Town, where he
made his stage
debut! Hayzee,
a noted Dayzee
producer, gave
Luigi a key role.
           -5- msg_luigi_book3_txt6 
Playing the part
of an earth
spirit to pure
perfection, Luigi
stole the show.
Hayzee's faith
in Luigi's natural
acting talents
was rewarded.
           -6- msg_luigi_book3_txt7 
The performance
won a prize,
which yielded
another compass
piece. Hayzee
turned from
teacher to pupil,
joining Luigi
on his quest.
           -7- msg_luigi_book3_txt8 
It was at this
time that Luigi's
heart, usually
draped in the
cool comfort of
a hero's resolve,
began to warm
with thoughts of
Princess Eclair.
           -8- msg_luigi_book3_txt9 
This came to be
because every
time the magic
compass pointed
to a new place,
her gentle words
rang in his ears,
touching him to
his very soul.
           -9- msg_luigi_book3_txt10 
The voice spoke
of eternity, of
stars in the
heavens. It wept
for those blind
to love. It gave
comfort in the
face of fear
and loneliness.
           -10- msg_luigi_book3_txt11 
Though he had
never seen her,
our hero was
tormented by
visions of this
fair-hearted
maiden. All he
could do was
press onward.
           -11- msg_luigi_book3_txt12 
The compass
pointed toward
Rapturous Ruins.
Only two parts
of the compass
awaited, and
Eclair had one...

           -1- msg_luigi_book4_txt2 
Footsore and
weary, Luigi
finally found the
Rapturous Ruins
beyond Grimble
Forest. Within
them, time and
space were lost
in nothingness.
        -2- msg_luigi_book4_txt3 
Within the pale
emptiness, Luigi
found a young
sleeping boy.
Our hero called
out gently, and
the youth woke
from his long,
long slumber.
           -3- msg_luigi_book4_txt4 
"My name is
Cranberry, and
I've waited for
you for the last
thousand years."
The boy went on
to tell Luigi the
secret truths of
an ancient land.
           -4- msg_luigi_book4_txt5 
He said that
the Marvelous
Compass had
been created by
the ancient Luff
people, who used
its powers of
foretelling to
rule the world.
           -5- msg_luigi_book4_txt6 
But the Luff
empire was then
cursed by the
compass, and
fell into ruin...
The survivors
dismantled the
compass and
hid its pieces.
           -6- msg_luigi_book4_txt7 
Cranberry was
the last of the
ancient race.
His role was to
wait until one
with a noble
heart came to
take the burden
of the future.
           -7- msg_luigi_book4_txt8 
None but Luigi
could have
shouldered this
weight. The boy
gave him the
compass piece,
and said, "Fear
the curse, but
find your Eclair."
           -8- msg_luigi_book4_txt9 
Luigi accepted
the part, the
boy's words
burned into his
brain. His duty
fulfilled, the boy
began to fade
into the blank
nothingness...
           -9- msg_luigi_book4_txt10 
As he faded
from sight, a 
look of joy lit
Cranberry's face.
As Luigi gaped,
both boy and
ruins vanished,
leaving our hero
in a dark wood.
           -10- msg_luigi_book4_txt11 
With six of the
parts united,
the compass now
pointed to the
final part... To
the quest's end...
To Hatesong
Tower. And then,
her voice spoke...
           -11- msg_luigi_book4_txt12 
Princess Eclair's
voice begged for
help from the
void, pleading
for a hero.
Luigi's heart
burst aflame...

           -1- msg_luigi_book5_txt2 
At long last,
Luigi crossed
the threshold
of Hatesong
Tower. Luigi
rallied his allies. 
"We will defeat
the Chestnut
King. We must!"
           -2- msg_luigi_book5_txt3 
Friends by his
side, Luigi at
last faced the
fell Chestnut
King...but then
he heard a
voice, and spun
to see the fair
Princess Eclair.
          -3- msg_luigi_book5_txt4 
She told our
hero the painful
truth: the "evil"
Chestnut King
was actually her
true love, made
monstrous by
Crepe in a bid
for the throne.
           -4- msg_luigi_book5_txt5 
At that moment,
the villainous
Crepe appeared.
"The Marvelous
Compass, please.
Hand it over,
and the Luff
empire will rule
again! Mwa ha!"
           -5- msg_luigi_book5_txt6 
Luigi and Co.
were no match
for the might
of Crepe, their
true enemy.
But then, the
compass piece
in Eclair's tiara
shone forth!
           -6- msg_luigi_book5_txt7 
It bestowed the
future-sight on
Luigi! Knowing
Crepe's every
move, he smote
the fiend with
his mallet! And
with that...it was
all finally over.
           -7- msg_luigi_book5_txt8 
Luigi and his
friends parted,
leaving the
Waffle Kingdom
in peace. But
Luigi regretted
not gazing
farther into the
future...
         -8- msg_luigi_book5_txt9 
He longed to
see the Wafflers
gathering on
Princess Eclair's
wedding day...
He wanted to
see her beauty,
and who stood
at her side...
           -9- msg_luigi_book5_txt10 
But it was not
to be. Luigi went
back to his
humble home,
which remained
exactly as he
had left it, a
cold comfort for
his heavy heart.
           -10- msg_luigi_book5_txt11 
Taking up a
book he had
been reading,
Luigi tried to
read, but his
long trial had
sapped his
strength, and he
soon fell asleep.
           -11- msg_luigi_book5_txt12 
Luigi dreamt
of his friends
and his beloved
Princess Eclair.
And sleeping,
Luigi spoke...
"I shall return."

<p>
Ouch! <wait 250>It's no use, Mario!
<wait 250>
They're all over me, man!<wait 250> 
What should we do?
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
I guess that's a dungeon
beyond us...<wait 300> Ick... <wait 250>There are
bones scattered everywhere.
<k>
<p>
Mmm...<wait 250> Mold and dust... <wait 250>Great.
<wait 300>
You could totally choke on
the stench in this place...
<k>
<p>
<wait 300><scale 0.67>
HAAAAAACK!
<k> リチャード <keyxon>
...Koops's dad?
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
No, I don't think so...
<k> リーダー <keyxon>
What a creepy pile of bones.
<wait 300>
I mean, they're ALL creepy,
but this one's SUPER-creepy!
<k>
<p>
I don't really feel like taking
a look at it, but if we don't,
we'll never get farther...
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This must be the great hall
of Hooktail Castle.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> I'd say
it's the center of the castle.
<k>
<p>
This place is so full of traps
and dangers... <wait 250>It's kind of
hard to get around, huh?
<k>
<p>
If we could just walk to a
window and look at the sky,
that might clear our heads...
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Hooktail Castle.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
You feel that upward-moving
draft in here?
<k>
<p>
Wow, sure is a big castle.
<wait 300>
Who do you think built it?
<wait 300>
So many questions!
<k>  

stg1_gon_12_01 What the heck?
<k> stg1_gon_12_02 Hey! <wait 250>Guests!<wait 250> It's been a long
time since anyone came here!
<wait 250>
A REAL long time!
<k> stg1_gon_12_03 ...Huh? <wait 250>You heard me?<wait 250> Wow!
<k>
<p>
Wait a sec'... <wait 250>If you can hear
my voice, you must be some
legendary hero or something...
<k> stg1_gon_12_04 Or not!
<k>
<p>
To be honest, I'm sure anyone
with ears can hear me.
<k>
<p>
...But it sure is fun zinging
people with that whole
"legendary hero" bit!
<k> stg1_gon_12_05 Hey, but seriously, folks,
I was wondering if you could
let me out of this chest...
<k>
<p>
I've been locked in here so
long, I'm starting to cramp
up like you wouldn't believe.
<k>
<p>
All you have to do is find the
key and let me out.<wait 250> Easy!
<k> stg1_gon_12_06 Huh? <wait 250>What do you mean?
<k>
<p>
You think you'll be cursed if
you open the box?<wait 250> Ridiculous!
<k>
<p>
Who would do that, really?<wait 250> 
Wait in a box and curse folks!
<wait 250>
A real slimeball, that's who!
<k>
<p>
But I'm not a real slimeball,
and I would do no such thing!
<wait 250>
But that should be obvious.
<k> stg1_gon_12_07 Look, if you help me out,
maybe I'll help you out.
<k>
<p>
You know, a little I-scratch-
your-back-you-scratch-mine!<wait 250> 
Except in reverse order.
<k>
<p>
Of course, you don't have to
if you really don't want to.
<wait 250>
Like finding a <icon black_key 1.0 -22 41 0> is hard...
<k> stg1_gon_12_08 You know the deal.<wait 250> I'll help
you out if you help me out.<wait 250> 
Back-scratching all around!
<k>
<p>
If you feel the urge to be a
pal, see if you can find the
key to this chest. <icon black_key 1.0 -22 41 0> 
<k> stg1_gon_12_09 Hey there!
<wait 250>
Boy, I am SO glad you found
that key! <wait 250>Unbelievable!
<k> stg1_gon_12_10 No!<wait 250> Wait!<wait 250> Don't do that!
<wait 250>
Look, you found the key...<wait 250>now
just use it to open this box.
<k>
 stg1_gon_12_11 <boss>
WHEEE HEE HEE HEE HEE!
<k>
<p>
FOOOOOOOLS!
<k> stg1_gon_12_12 <boss>
Why, only the most idiotic,
pudding-brained dolt would
fall for a scheme like that!
<k>
<p>
The castle's traps prevent
anyone who's entered this
place from ever leaving it!
<k>
<p>
No matter which path you
take, you're fated to waste
away to a slow, painful end!
<k>
<p>
But wait!<wait 250> There's more to
this great deal! <wait 250>I'll throw in
a free CURSE!<wait 250> No charge!
<k>
<p>
Oogly-googly-BOO!
<k> stg1_gon_12_13 <boss>
<shake>
Wheee hee hee hee hee!
<wait 250>
Now you're cursed, doofus!
<wait 250>
And it serves you right!
<k>
<p>
This curse is more cursedly
curse-worthy than any curse
that's ever cursed you!
<k>
<p>
For...<wait 250>this curse makes you
like a piece of paper when
you press and hold <icon BUTTON_R 0.5 -21 36 -10>!
<k>
<p>
Wheeee hee hee hee hee!<wait 250> 
What a curse! <wait 250>Who curses
like me?<wait 250> NO ONE!
<k>
<o> stg1_gon_12_14 <p>
<boss>
Now I shall show you just how
frightful a curse it is!
<wait 250>
Go on! <wait 250>Press and hold <icon BUTTON_R 0.5 -21 36 -10>!
<k>
<p>
Press and hold <icon BUTTON_R 0.5 -21 36 -10> now!!!
<o> stg1_gon_12_15 <boss>
Wheeee hee hee hee hee!
<wait 250>
Just look at yourself!<wait 250> 
How embarrassing for you!
<k>
<p>
Eat a sandwich, skinny!<wait 250> Hee!<wait 250> 
...Do you understand what
this curse means for you?
<o> stg1_gon_12_15_1 <boss>
You idiot! <wait 250>Press and hold <icon BUTTON_R 0.5 -22 36 -10>!
<wait 250>
Press and hold <icon BUTTON_R 0.5 -21 36 -10> and be
ashamed!
<o> stg1_gon_12_15_yn <select 0 -1 0 40>
No
Yes stg1_gon_12_16 <p>
<boss>
You idiot! <wait 250>Press and hold <icon BUTTON_R 0.5 -21 34 -10>!
<wait 250>
Press and hold <icon BUTTON_R 0.5 -21 36 -10> and be
ashamed!
<o> stg1_gon_12_17 <p>
<boss>
Then farewell, you dumbbells!
<k>
<p>
Wheee hee hee hee hee!
<k> stg1_gon_18_00_kur Whoa! <wait 250>I mean, WHOA!
<wait 300>
That was seriously close!
<k>
<p>
Well, whatever.<wait 250> We got the
key, so let's go open that
weird chest.
<k> stg1_gon_18_00_nok Man...<wait 300> That was TOO close!
<k>
<p>
Gotta shake it off...<wait 250> Hoo.<wait 250> 
OK. <wait 250>We got the key, so let's
go open that spooky chest.
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
These are the dungeons of
Hooktail Castle.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> I don't think
they're in use, but...yuck.
<k>
<p>
Hey, y'know, I was meaning
to ask...<wait 300> Have you mastered
Koops's "Hold" move yet?
<k>
<p>
When Koops is with you, just
press and hold <icon PAD_X_ON 0.5 -20 35 -10> to make his
shell stop ahead of you.
<k>
<p>
You can even move around
while it stays there!<wait 300> Try it
out in different areas!
<k>  

stg1_gon_15_kur Mario!<wait 250> Look at that!
<k> stg1_gon_16_kur Ooh, this isn't good...<wait 250> 
Hurry! <wait 250>Run for it!
<k> stg1_gon_15_nok Ummm... <wait 250>M-Mario...<wait 250> 
L-Look at that!
<k> stg1_gon_16_nok Oh, I don't like the look of
this... <wait 250>Come on!<wait 250> Run!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
What a totally weird room.
<wait 300>
There's just gotta be
something hidden here.
<k>
<p>
Then again, EVERY room in
this castle is totally weird...
<k>  

irai_07_00 Blast!
<k>
<p>
So...<wait 250>you found me. <wait 250>Curses!<wait 250> 
I felt sure that none would
ever find me here...
<k>
<p>
I'm a master, you see. <wait 250>I love
sneaking and hiding so much,
I just never stop!
<k>
<p>
It WAS a hobby, but I kept
hiding...<wait 250>and soon I was known
as the Hide 'n' Seek Koopa!
<k> irai_07_01 Koopook!
<k>
<p>
I thought it was you! <wait 250>We used
to be neighbors back when
we were barely shell-high!
<k> irai_07_02 ......................................................................
......................................................................
...Koops?<wait 250> Is that you?
<k>
<p>
Yes!<wait 250> Koops!<wait 250> The same Koops
who always had to be it
when we played hide 'n' seek!
<k>
<p>
...But you never found me.<wait 250> 
Not even once! <wait 250>I can't
believe you finally did it!
<k> irai_07_03 Yeah, I remember back then...
<wait 250>
That one day, you hid, and
no one ever found you...
<k> irai_07_04 Right! <wait 250>That was the very day
that I decided to become the
Hide 'n' Seek Koopa!
<k>
<p>
Ever since that day, I've
hid and snuck and snuck and
hid my way through life.
<k> irai_07_05 ......................................................................
......................................................................
...Yup. <wait 250>That was a crazy day.
<k> irai_07_06 But...<wait 250>since you found me this
time, I'll give you a reward,
like I promised.
<k> irai_07_07 I found this while I was
traveling and hiding around
the world. <wait 250>I don't need it.
<k>
<p>
Well, I'm off! <wait 250>Time to go
look for a new hiding place!<wait 250> 
Wish me luck!
<k>
<p>
I guess I've still got a lot to
learn about hiding if YOU
found me, Koops.
<k>
<p>
It was nice seeing you again,
though! <wait 250>See you later.
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Hooktail Castle.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
There's an upward-moving
draft in this room, too.
<k>
<p>
Of course, tons of bones
lying around, too.<wait 250> This place
needs a decorator, STAT!
<k>
<p>
You never know which bones
are gonna attack, so careful
where you walk, OK?
<k>
<p>
Oh, and if you want to ride
that green block, remember,
Koops is the MAN!
<k> ƒmƒbƒRƒX <keyxon>
Hey, y'know, I wonder...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Could this be Koopook, who
asked us for help?
<k>
<p>
Y'know, the guy who asked us
to find him somewhere in
Hooktail's castle?
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Hooktail Castle.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
The door up on that platform
to the right is hard to reach.
<k>
<p>
I wonder if the switch on the
right might control the block
that could get us up there...
<k>
<p>
Looks like a job for Koops...
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
Mario, take a look at this!
<wait 300>
It's like you could reach out
and touch the sky, huh?
<k>
<p>
Looking out from the heights
makes my head go goomby...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I mean... <wait 250>I mean goony!
<k>  

stg1_gon_19 <boss>
Who dares approach me?
<k> stg1_gon_19_2 <boss>
Hmm...<wait 250> So... <wait 250>You are friends
of the strange-garbed one
who came earlier?
<k>
<p>
I didn't expect more to come
to steal the treasure I
protect... <wait 250>Such rashness...
<k> stg1_gon_20 <boss>
That was foolish, I fear.
<wait 250>
Do you really think you can
beat me?
<k> stg1_gon_20_2 <boss>
But you're so small. <wait 250>And you
don't appear tasty. <wait 250>I suppose
you might make a good snack.
<k>
<p>
And the bottoms of your feet
smell like they might make a
good sauce with some spices.
<k>
<p>
What I'll do is saute you to
crispy goodness and gobble
you down...<wait 250>HEADFIRST!
<k> stg1_gon_20_3 <boss>
Snack time, little appetizers!<wait 250> 
But which one of you morsels
should I taste first?
<k> stg1_gon_21 <boss>
Bleck!<wait 250> That awful sound!
<wait 250>
It...sounds like a cricket!
<wait 250>
How did you know?
<k>
<p>
Stop that this instant!
<k>
<p>
Urp... <wait 250>I got really bad...<wait 250>ugh...<wait 250> 
food poisoning once when I
ate a cricket.<wait 250> I HATE them!
<k>
<p>
Oh... <wait 250>Fight it, Hooky...
<wait 250>
Just hearing a cricket chirp
makes me feel woozy!
<k> stg1_gon_22 <boss>
Ooooog...<wait 250> Must...<wait100>not...<wait 250>gag...
<wait 250>
My poor tummy...<wait 250> Uuuuurp...
<wait 250>
So very woozy...
<k> stg1_gon_23 <boss>
W-Wait! <wait 250>Hold up a moment!
<k> stg1_gon_24 <boss>
I give up!<wait 250> Please!
<k>
<p>
I won't be so bad anymore.
I promise! <wait 250>In fact, I'm sorry!<wait 250> 
For everything!
<k>
<p>
Er... <wait 250>Yeah...
<k>
<p>
To prove it, I'll give you 1,000
coins!<wait 250> What do you say?
<wait 250>
Can you forgive me?
<o> stg1_gon_24_yesno1 <select 0 1 0 40>
For 1,000 coins? Sure!
Keep your coins, fiend! stg1_gon_25 <boss>
Delicious!<wait 250> I knew you would!
<wait 250>
Money makes the world turn!
<wait 250>
Now, come get your coins...
<k> stg1_gon_26 <boss>
What?<wait 250> You must be joking!
<wait 250>
You don't need any coins?
<k>
<p>
Then how about the lovely,
rare, extra-special badge
I have? <wait 250>I'll give you that.
<k>
<p>
It's one of a kind!<wait 250> And it's
yours for a limited time only!<wait 250> 
<wait 250>Will you take it?
<o> stg1_gon_26_yesno1 <select 0 1 0 40>
A rare badge? Sure!
Keep it, you cad! stg1_gon_27 <boss>
Of course you want it!
<wait 250>
Who wouldn't?<wait 250> Now, come
here and get your badge...
<k> stg1_gon_28 <boss>
Errrr... <wait 250>Really?!?
<k>
<p>
Well, I suppose I could
apologize by letting you
smell the bottoms of my feet.
<k>
<p>
People pay good money to do
this. <wait 250>I'm being completely
honest right now.<wait 250> Really.
<k>
<p>
So? <wait 250>Care to take a whiff of
the rich, yet delicate scent
of my world-renowned feet?
<o> stg1_gon_28_yesno1 <select 0 1 0 40>
Maybe just a quick sniff...
That's disgusting! stg1_gon_29 <boss>
Heh heh heh...<wait 250> Thought so.
<wait 250>
No nostril contact, though!
<wait 250>
Now!<wait 250> Come here and sniff!
<k> stg1_gon_30 <boss>
OHHHH ho ho ho ho ho ho!
<wait 250>
You were completely duped
by my ingenious ruse!
<k> stg1_gon_30_01 Coward!
<k> stg1_gon_30_02 How cowardly!
<k> stg1_gon_30_03 <boss>
You senseless yokels!
<wait 250>
Nothing in life is that easy!
<wait 250>
Your gullibility did you in!
<k> stg1_gon_30_04 <boss>
Errr... <wait 250>This isn't looking
so good...
<k>
<p>
I guess I'd better...
<k> stg1_gon_31 <boss>
Hrrrrrrrrmmmm!
<wait 250>
You aren't a very trusting
fellow, are you?
<k>
<p>
It's important to be able to
trust someone, you know.
<k>
<p>
Err... <wait 250>I guess I'd better...
<k> stg1_gon_31_00_kur That's just terrible!
<k> stg1_gon_31_00_nok That's just not right!
<k> stg1_gon_31_01 <boss>
Ohhh ho ho ho ho ho ho!
<wait 250>
Ahhh! <wait 250>Now my strength has
returned to me!
<k> stg1_gon_31_02 That's it!<wait 250> Enough of this!
<wait 250>
Let's finish him off once

<k> stg1_gon_33_01_nok Wow! <wait 250>We actually pulled it
off, Mario!
<k> stg1_gon_33_02_kur All we have to do now is
search for that Crystal Star
we can't seem to locate.
<k> stg1_gon_33_02_nok Now all we have to do is find
that Crystal Star thing
you're looking for, Mario.
<k> stg1_gon_33_03 Oooo...

<p>
Ooooooooooooo...
<k> stg1_gon_33_04 YAAAAAAAAAAAH! <wait 250>I'm out!<wait 250>

<k> stg1_gon_33_08 Hey! <wait 250>You're...<wait 250> You're Koops!
<k>
<p>
Hey, Son!<wait 250> You've gotten so
big since I saw you last!
<k> stg1_gon_33_09 Well, yeah, I guess I have...<wait 250> 
But who cares, Dad?
<k>
<p>
I mean, golly! <wait 250>What happened
to you? <wait 250>Where've you been
all this time?
<k> stg1_gon_33_10 Well, I came here a while
back to deal with Hooktail,
and all was well and good...
<k>
<p>
But just before my finishing
blow, he played a trick on me
and gobbled me down whole.
<k>
<p>
I've been hiding in my shell
for the ten years since then...
<wait 250>
inside Hooktail's belly!
<k>
<p>
And boy, was it nasty!<wait 250> Yuck!<wait 250> 
I'm so glad to finally get out!
<wait 250>
Ahh ha ha ha ha ha!
<k> stg1_gon_33_11 Honestly, Dad...
<wait 250>
Don't you know how worried
about you we all were?
<k>
<p>
For ten long years we all
thought you'd...<wait 250>you know!<wait 250> We
thought your game was over!
<k> stg1_gon_33_12 Oh, sorry, Son, but...
<wait 250>
I'm OK!<wait 250> That's good, right?
<wait 250>
We're together now, right?
<k>
<p>
Hey, speaking of which...
<wait 250>
What are you doing here,
anyway?
<k> stg1_gon_33_13 Oh, come on, Dad...
<k>
<p>
I came here to defeat
Hooktail, who's been
wreaking havoc in town.
<k>
<p>
And Mr. Mario here is
looking for a gem called
the Crystal Star.
<k> stg1_gon_33_14 ...Crystal Star?
<k>
<p>
This wouldn't be what you're
talking about, would it?
<k> stg1_gon_33_15 What's THAT?
<k> stg1_gon_33_16 I found it down there in
Hooktail's belly.<wait 250> Nice, huh?<wait 250> 
I kept it as a souvenir.
<k>
<p>
So...<wait 250>this is the thing you're
looking for?
<k>
<p>
Perfect! <wait 250>Just perfect!
<wait 250>
You can have it!
<k> stg1_gon_33_17 Come now! <wait 250>I won't take no
for an answer.<wait 250> You're Koops's
friend.<wait 250> Please take it!
<k> stg1_gon_33_18 <system>
You got a Crystal Star!
<k>
<p>
And you learned the special
move Earth Tremor!
<k> stg1_gon_34 <diary>
<wpos -280 100 560 176>
Mario and friends finally got
a Crystal Star in the castle
after defeating Hooktail.
<k>
<p>
Koops even reunited with
his long-lost father, whom
he thought was dead.
<k>
<p>
Yet they were unable to

Where could Princess
Peach be?

Yes...<wait 250> Mario's adventure
has only just begun.

This is Hooktail's lair.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Yup, the highest chamber in
the castle!
<k>
<p>
Now, where's Hooktail, huh?
<k>
<p>
<wave>
Hmmm...</wave><wait 300> Y'know, maybe we
should be glad it's not
around at the moment...
<k>  

stg1_gon_18_01 <se 1>
Huh?<wait 250> Oh, my!<wait 250> Who's this
handsome piece of cheese?
<k>
<p>
I can't believe there are
other thieves here besides
me.<wait 250> How very strange...
<k> stg1_gon_18_02_kur Who... <wait 250>Who are you?
<k> stg1_gon_18_02_nok H-Hey!<wait 250> Who are you?
<k> stg1_gon_18_04 <se 1>
Me? <wait 250>Why, I'm Ms. Mowz,
the globe-trotting thief!
<wait 250>
Heard of me, sweetie? <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k>
<p>
I heard there were rare and
valuable badges here in this
castle. <wait 250>That's why I'm here.
<k>
<p>
But the real question is...<wait 250>why
are people like YOU roaming
in such a run-down place?
<k> stg1_gon_18_05_kur I'll tell you why, Miss Ugly-
Pink-Shoe-Whatever-Thief:
<wait 250>
we're here to beat Hooktail!
<k>
<p>
And just so we're clear on
this, we set our sights on the
Crystal Star before you! OK?
<k> stg1_gon_18_05_nok Umm, well, you see... <wait 250>We're
here to beat Hooktail and
get the...<wait 250>um...<wait 250>Crystal Star.
<k>
<p>
So...<wait 250>don't think we'll let you
get the Crystal Star first,
no matter how cute you are!
<k> stg1_gon_18_07 <se 1>
...Crystal Star, you say?
Mmmm hmm hmm!
<k>
<p>
I didn't know a thing like
THAT was hidden in this
castle... <wait 250>Sounds intriguing!
<k>
<p>
Perhaps I just heard
something you didn't want me
hearing?<wait 250> Mmm hmm hmm hmm!
<k> stg1_gon_18_08_kur Shoot!
<k> stg1_gon_18_08_nok Darn!
<k> stg1_gon_18_10 <se 1>
Oh, but that's OK...
<wait 250>
I mean, you were looking for
this Crystal Star first...
<k>
<p>
And I already found the
badge I was after, so I'll let
you get your Crystal Star. <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k> stg1_gon_18_11_kur LET us?!?<wait 250> LET us?!?<wait 250> What's
that supposed to mean?
<k> stg1_gon_18_11_nok Ummm...<wait 250> Hey!<wait 250> What's that
supposed to mean?
<k> stg1_gon_18_13 <se 1>
Mmmm hmm hmm hmm! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
It means I must say bye-bye
for now, Mr. Cutie.
<k>
<p>
I know.<wait 250> It's sad.<wait 250> We just met,
and already it is time to
say farewell. <wait 250>Alas... <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k> stg1_gon_18_14_kur H-HEY!<wait 250> You little flirt!
<wait 250>
Who do you think you are,
kissing Mario?!?
<k> stg1_gon_18_14_nok Oh, my!<wait 250> You're so...<wait 250>bold...<wait 250> 
Is that legal?
<k> stg1_gon_18_16 <se 1>
Oh, I almost forgot...
<wait 250>
I have a little secret to
share with you. <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k>
<p>
Somewhere in this castle is
a badge that'll help you best
Hooktail, or so I've heard.
<k>
<p>
I don't know what kind of
badge it is.<wait 250> Maybe you found
it already, maybe not.
<k>
<p>
If you're going to fight
Hooktail, I'd recommend
finding that badge first.
<k>
<p>
Well, take care, handsome
mustache man! <wait 250>Let's get
together again real soon!
<k> stg1_gon_18_17_kur What is WITH that girl?
<wait 250>
What a flirt! <wait 250>Who acts so
disgusting like that?
<o>
<k> stg1_gon_18_17_nok I wonder what her story is...
<wait 250>
I bet it's an interesting one...
<wait 250>
Full of romance...
<o>
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Hooktail's treasure
room.
<k>
<p>
Ms. Mowz was looking for
something here, but I don't
think there's anything left.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is a hidden room in
Hooktail Castle.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Who knew
there was a room in here?
<k>
<p>
Well...<wait 300> I guess secret rooms
are supposed to be secret...
<k>  

 

mac_0_014 I must apologize, sir.
<wait 250>
Our arrival was delayed just
a bit by rough weather...
<k>
<p>
Are you quite sure you want
to disembark here?
<k>
<p>
I...<wait 250>did tell you all the sordid
tales about Rogueport on our
way here, did I not?
<k> mac_0_015 What's that?<wait 250> I'm sorry?
<wait 250>
You say there's a princess
waiting here for you?
<k>
<p>
<wait 200>
Is that so?<wait 250> Er...<wait 250> Of course, sir.
<wait 250>
Well, if that's what you think,
then I won't stop you.
<k>
<p>
But, uh... <wait 250>You be careful, sir.
<wait 250>
Don't say I didn't warn you!

Hey! <wait 250>What do you want?!?

<k> mac_0_017 Oh, come off it, you airhead!
<wait 250>
I know it's tough for you, but
don't play dumb with me!
<k>
<p>
I've seen you walking around
town asking for information
about the Crystal Stars.
<k>
<p>
Well, now I'm doing the asking,
so be a good girl and tell us
what you know!<wait 250> Right.<wait 250> NOW!
<k> mac_0_018 Never! <wait 250>I don't have anything
to say to you creeps! <wait 250>Eww!
<k> mac_0_019 I suppose it wouldn't be right
if a sassy little lass like you
met with an untimely demise...
<k>
<p>
Buh! <wait 250>Buh! <wait 250>Buh huh huh!
<wait 250>
Boys, we're taking this
firebrand to our fortress!

<wait 250>
We're on it!
<k> mac_0_021 N-No!<wait 250> Stop right there, you
weirdos!<wait 250> I'll scream! <wait 250>Really!
<k> mac_0_022 Like I'd go anywhere with
smelly lunatics like you!
<wait 250><dynamic 3>
Hmph! <wait 250>Not likely!
<k> mac_0_023 Whuh?
<k>
<p>
What do you think YOU'RE
doing, chump?<wait 250> You think you
can screw up my plans?!?
<k> mac_0_024 Gah!<wait 250> It's always something...
<k>
<p>
Looks like I'm going to have
to give you a little taste

<k> mac_0_b_t1_000 <col c00000ff>Battle</col> time, Mister Man!
<wait 300>

this freak of the week, OK?
<k>
<p>
Don't sweat the details.
Just <col c00000ff>jump</col> on him and hit
him with your <col c00000ff>hammer</col>!
<k> mac_0_b_t1_001 Sweet!<wait 250> You KNOW that hurt!
<wait 250>
Wow, I gotta say, you're
tougher than you look.
<k>
<p>
Keep it up and you'll beat
him in no time!
<k> mac_0_b_t1_002 Yes! <wait 250>You're doing awesome!
<wait 250>
Don't you let up!
<k> mac_0_b_t1_003 You've got him on the ropes!
<wait 250>
C'mon! <wait 250>Keep whaling on him!
<k> mac_0_b_t1_004 You did it! <wait 250>You did it!<wait 250> YESSS!
<wait 250>
And you got <col c00000ff>Star Points</col>!!!
<k> mac_0_b_t1_005 Yeah, I bet you know, but you
get these things called Star
Points when you win battles.
<k>
<p>
When you get 100 points,
you'll <col c00000ff>go up a level</col>.
<wait 250>
Don't forget that, OK?
<k> mac_0_025 Buh!<wait 250> Buh!<wait 250> Buh huh huh!
<wait 250>
OK, you got a couple decent

Daddy asked you to find us?
<wait 250>
And take us to him?!?
<k> mac_2_074 Frankie, what should we do?
<wait 250>
If Daddy finds us now...

Oh, I don't know...<wait 100>and the

Don't you know what he'll do

We can't keep runnin' forever.

We can, Frankie!<wait 250> The more

Until I marry you, no one

<k> mac_2_083 Don't you see, Mister?

Fine! <wait 100>Have it your way! <wait 100>But

<k> mac_2_087_01 Aww, what am I gonna do
wit' dis crazy dame?
<k> mac_2_088_kur What should we do, Mario?
<wait 250>
We at least have to tell
Don Pianta SOMETHING...
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 100> That stuff about our
luck turning terrible didn't
sound all that appetizing...
<k> mac_2_088_nok Umm... <wait 100>What should we do?
<wait 250>
I mean, I guess we should go
tell Don Pianta something.
<k>
<p>
But I...<wait 100> I don't want our luck
to turn terrible... <wait 100>Whatever
THAT means!
<k> mac_2_088_win Oh, whatever should we do?
<wait 250>
We have to say SOMETHING
to that Don Pianta fellow...
<k>
<p>
I must say, though...<wait 100> I don't
fancy a run of terrible luck.
<wait 250>
That would be unfortunate.
<k> mac_4_024 I wish I knew for sure
whether or not my older
brother was on Keelhaul Key...
<k> mac_4_025 If I could just get my mitts
on that treasure, I'd never
work again, by crummity!
<k>
<p>
I could frolic all day like
a big, bloomin' sea turtle!
<wait 250>
Don't 'urt to dream, do it?
<k> mac_4_027 Starboard ho!<wait 250> Port ho!
<wait 250>
Giant monster Blooper ho!
<wait 250>
I'm practicing my "ho's"!
<k> mac_4_028 Right fair weather today, eh?
<wait 250>
Yeah, perfect day to set sail,
if I do say so!
<k>
<p>
Wouldn't mind a bit if the
whole journey blew in fair as
today, no sirree bob!
<k> mac_4_029 Uh, pleased to meet...
<wait 250>
Um, your acquaintance...
<wait 250>
Buh huh huh huh huh...
<k> mac_4_029_01 At last, my dreams will come
true! <wait 250>I'm gonna open my very
own shop on Keelhaul Key!
<k>
<p>
I don't care if it's small
and ramshackle!<wait 250> It'll be mine!
<wait 250>
I just have one slight worry...
<k>
<p>
Keelhaul Key is a deserted,
cursed island...<wait 250> You think I'll
get much foot traffic?
<k> mac_4_029_02 I...<wait 250> I always dreamed of the
day I'd leave this town.
<k>
<p>
I don't care if there are
pirates or ghosts or undead
vampires where we're going.
<k>
<p>
It's gotta be worlds better
than this stinkhole!
<k> mac_4_030 Ah, yes.<wait 250> So it is you, ah?
<wait 250>
Well, sadly, a slight problem
seems to have popped up.
<k>
<p>
But feast your eyes on this
outrageously fantastic ship!
<wait 250>
She is a fine vessel, no?
<k>
<p>
She is the S.S. Flavion.
<wait 250>
The queen of the countless
ships in my personal fleet!
<k>
<p>
The raw majesty of her hull!
<wait 100>
The pomp and circumstance!
<wait 100>
None can compare to her.
<k>
<p>
Ah!<wait 100> Behold the elegant curve
of her prow!<wait 100> She cuts to the
very SOUL!<wait 250> Don't you agree?
<k>
<p>
But she is not just a beauty...
<wait 250>
She is a savage beast on the
water, tops among sailboats!
<k>
<p>
But above all, I tell you,
this proud ship can...
<k> mac_4_031 Ah!<wait 100> Yes?<wait 250> Did you speak?
<wait 250>
Yes, yes, yes, of course.<wait 250> The
problem that has sprung up.
<k>
<p>
...I had completely forgotten
about it.<wait 250> The S.S. Flavion,
she bewitches me...
<k>
<p>
Yes, well... <wait 100>Here is the issue.
<wait 250>
We...<wait 100>have no navigator.
<wait 250>
He ran off, the dog.
<k>
<p>
The navigator, of course, is
the highest-ranked helmsman.
<wait 250>
They steer ships, you know.
<k>
<p>
Now, here is the real problem.
<wait 100>
The waters around Keelhaul
Key are deathly dangerous.
<k>
<p>
We need an absurdly skilled
helmsman for our navigator.
<wait 250>
It is a, how you say?<wait 250> A pickle.
<k> mac_4_032 Oy, Flavio!
<k> mac_4_033 Heard you talkin' there, sir!
<wait 250>
If you don't mind me sayin'...
<wait 250>
I might 'ave a solution...
<k> mac_4_034 Do not tease me, Pa-Patch!
<wait 250>
You can solve our problem?
<wait 300>
Then spit it out, already!
<k> mac_4_035 Well, sir, I've 'eard talk of
a famed... <wait 100>No!<wait 100> A LEGENDARY
sailor livin' in Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, I think he's called
Admiral Bobbery...<wait 250> A salty old
sea dog, by all accounts...
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 100>he's said to 'ave the
Helmsman's Touch, sir: <wait 100>he can
make any ship bow to his will.
<k>
<p>
Thing is, there ain't a soul
wot's seen him on the seas
of late... 
<k> mac_4_036 Bassa-boom! <wait 250>Problem solved!
<wait 250>
Let us scout out this Bobbery
fellow and get him on board!
<k> mac_4_037 As is customary, my captain
will handle all negotiations.
<wait 250>
That...<wait 100>would be you, Mario.
<k>
<p>
That DOES sound fair to
everyone, does it not?
<k> mac_4_038 <small>
<scale 0.67>

<scale 0.67>
Sure thing!
<wait 1000> mac_4_044 ...Then it is decided.
<k>
<p>
You must find this Bobbery
and bring him here.<wait 250> Our
fortune sails with you!
<k> mac_4_045 You must find this Bobbery
and bring him here.<wait 250> Our
fortune sails with you!
<k> mac_4_045_01 You found someone who
matches Bobbery's description
but claims he is not him?
<k>
<p>
Strange... <wait 250>I would ask someone
who is knowledgeable about
the neighborhood about this.
<k> mac_4_045_02 Bobbery refused?<wait 250> How vexing.
<wait 250>
But...<wait 100>is it not your job to
solve this problem, hmm?
<k>
<p>
Why don't you find someone
who knows Bobbery and see
what you can find out?
<k> mac_4_088 Ah, the smell of the sea...
<wait 250>
I'd forgotten how sweet a
scent it can be...
<k> mac_4_089 I knew you would get Bobbery
on board, you wonderful
mustached man, you!
<k>
<p>
To you, I must say AHOY!
<wait 250>
I was wise to choose you as
captain! <wait 100>Ahoy to me, as well!
<k> mac_4_090 My men have already loaded

<wait 250>
Ah...<wait 250> That was harsh.
<k> mac_5_000_05 Such is life, Captain Mario.
<wait 250>
You are anxious to continue
your own adventure also, ah?
<k> mac_5_000_06 One day you may surpass the
great and fabulous Flavio in
greatness and fabulousness.
<k>
<p>
It is not likely, I assure you,
but you should, how you say,
shoot for the stars, ah?
<k>
<p>
If ever you should reach
the pinnacle, remember to
shout "FLAVIO" to the wind!
<k> mac_5_000_07 <boss>
That reminds me, amigo...
<k> mac_5_000_08 <boss>
If you ever get the urge to
return to Keelhaul Key, just
say the word, OK?
<k>
<p>
I will send you to the island
faster than the fastest
winds blow, comprende?
<k> mac_5_000_09 Yes, yes, you giant skull, you.
<wait 250>
Your time in the spotlight
is done. <wait 100>Get over yourself.
<k>
<p>
AHEM!
<k>
<p>
Well, my adoring fans have
gone, so I will be excusing
myself now, as well.
<k>
<p>
If you see me in town, I would
permit you to say hello to me.
<wait 250>
May we meet again, ah?
<k> mac_5_000_10_kur Well, Mario,<wait 250> we probably
oughta go, too, don'tcha

<k> mac_5_000_10_nok Well, Mario...<wait 250> I guess we
should go, too. <wait 100>Let's head
down to the door, huh?
<k> mac_5_000_10_win Well, that's that, Mario...
<wait 250>
I suppose we should go, too.
<wait 100>
Let's make for the door.
<k> mac_5_000_10_yos OK, Gonzales!<wait 250> That's our cue!
<wait 100>
Let's break out of here and
head for the door!
<k> mac_5_000_10_viv So, Mario...<wait 250> Don't you think
maybe we should go, too?
<wait 250>
Maybe go to the door.
<k> mac_5_000_10_bom Well, well, well, old boy...
<wait 250>
I should think we'd head
for that door at this point.
<k> mac_5_000_10_chu Mario...<wait 250> I think the time is
right for us to head for
the door, don't you think?
<k> mac_5_038 We have to go see Daddy
immediately!
<k> mac_5_039 You got it, Francesca!
<k> mac_8_01 You're a strange one, sir.
<wait 250>
It must be something special
to convince you to return.
<k>
<p>
Although, if I had a Goomba
that cute waiting for me at
the dock, I might return, too.
<k>
<p>
Well, whatever you're doing,
be careful.<wait 250> Good-bye, sir!
<k> mac_8_02 Long time, no see, Mario!
<wait 250>

<p>
You mean the island where
the treasure hoard of Cortez,
the pirate king, is hidden?
<k>
<p>
So...you want treasure, eh?
<wait 250>
Fine, but keep an eye out or

You an that mental Flavio...
<wait 250>
Uh, rather, that dashin' guy...

Well, at any rate, be careful.
<wait 250>
That island is right nasty.
<wait 250>
Prepare yourself, eh?
<k> gor_00_02_08_01 Admiral Bobbery?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, sure, that bloke used
to practically live at Podley's
Place, on the plaza.
<k>
<p>
He'd stay too late every now
an' then an' that lovely wife
of his would pick 'im up.
<k> gor_00_02_08_02 Going at last, are ya?
<wait 250>
Try not to die a 'orrible
death, all right, then?
<k> gor_00_02_09 So, there WERE ghosts, eh?
<wait 250>
I don't care what kinda ship

ship of yours sometime!
<k> gor_00_03_01 What you want, pal?<wait 250> Huh?
<wait 250>
A princess in a pink dress?
<k>
<p>
I ain't seen nothing like
that, no.<wait 250> I'd remember a
princess, probably.
<k>
<p>
Why do you want this chick,
anyway, pal?<wait 250> Owe you money?
<wait 250>
Or is she yer girlfriend?
<k> gor_00_03_02 Not that you care, but I
gave up all my life's dreams.
<wait 250>
Now I just stare at the sea.
<k>
<p>
I walk around...<wait 250>alone.<wait 250> I wait
for a ship that never returns.
<wait 250>
Life stinks, you know that?

<k> gor_00_03_04 Once, a great pirate named
Cortez wreaked havoc on
these seas, y'know.

<k> gor_00_03_07 See that ship docked there?
<wait 250>
She belongs to Flavio, the
merchant trader.
<k>
<p>
He don't sail too often,
though. <wait 250>Mostly he hangs at
Podley's joint on the plaza.
<k> gor_00_03_08 Off to that island, are ya?
<wait 250>
Well, at least Flavio's ship is
the best in the harbor.
<k>
<p>
You oughta be fine<wait 150> as long as
you don't see any ghosts.
<k>
<p>
But<wait 250> if the pirate king's curse
is real, there ain't a ship on

<k> gor_00_03_08_02 I'm more interested in the
casualties of a treasure hunt
than I am in the treasure.
<k>
<p>
Morbid, huh?<wait 250> Yeah, I know.
<wait 250>
Well, you try not to become
a treasure ghost, OK, pal?
<k> gor_00_03_09 If it weren't for you, those
guys never would've returned.
<wait 250>
Thanks, pal!

<wait 250>
Sniff...<wait 250> I love you, man.
<k> gor_00_04_01 Hey, in case you don't know,
the plaza's through the gate
at the top of the stairs.
<k>
<p>
There are shops and inns and
stuff there. <wait 250>You ought to
take a good look around.
<k> gor_00_04_02 Hey, in case you don't know,

<k> gor_00_04_03 You know what I've learned?
<wait 250>
The world is full of strange
and mysterious places.<wait 250> Yup.
<k>
<p>
I sure would love to go see
them all one day.<wait 250> That'd be a
logistical nightmare, though.
<k> gor_00_04_04 Yup, the world sure is full of
strange and mind-warpingly
wonderful places, all right...
<k>
<p>
What's that? <wait 250>...Boggly Woods?
<wait 250>
Huh!<wait 250> Never heard of them...
<wait 250>
I'd love to see 'em one day...
<k> gor_00_04_05 Yup, the world sure is full of
strange and mind-bogglingly

What's that? A sky-city?
<wait 250>
Huh! <wait 250>Never heard of THAT...
<wait 250>
I'd love to see it one day...
<k> gor_00_04_06 Yup, the world sure is full of

<p>
...A town in perpetual dusk?
<wait 250>
Huh! <wait 250>Never heard of THAT...
<wait 250>
I'd love to see it one day...
<k> gor_00_04_07 ...What? Keelhaul Key?
<wait 250>
Oh, that place is absolutely
awful, I've heard.
<k>
<p>
Not long ago, ship after ship
went there hunting treasure,
but none ever returned...
<k>
<p>
I bet they met the bad end
of the pirate king's curse.
<wait 250>
Those guys were dumb.
<k> gor_00_04_08 Setting sail at last, eh?
<wait 250>
Treasure has its allure, but
my family needs me.
<k>
<p>
Dreaming dreams is all well
and good, but certain-death
voyages? <wait 250>I'll pass, thanks.
<k> gor_00_04_08_01 Admiral Bobbery?
<k>
<p>
I'm fairly sure there was an
old guy by that name living
in the east part of town.

<k> gor_00_04_09 Wow, those guys all looked
excited...<wait 250> They didn't get rich,
but I still kind of envy them.
<k> gor_00_04_10 ...Poshley Heights?<wait 250> Only filthy-
rich folks live there, right?
<wait 250>
Not that I've ever been...
<k> gor_00_04_11 WHAT?!?<wait 250> You went to the
dang moon?
<k>
<p>
Why should I believe you?
<wait 250>
Did you get the man in the
moon's autograph?
<k> gor_00_04_12 What?!? <wait 250>There was an evil
shadow queen sleeping deep
beneath this town?!?
<k>
<p>
Huh? <wait 250>And you defeated her?
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
Listen...<wait 250> You really need to
quit with the compulsive lying.
<k> gor_00_05_01 Yikes. <wait 250>Looks like trouble
over there...<wait 250> Probably best
not to get involved, huh?
<k>
<p>
I wouldn't meddle with other
people's problems in this town,
even if I had an extra life.
<k> gor_00_05_02 Who, me?<wait 250> Well, I'm a bit down.
<wait 250>
My older brother left port

<k>
<p>
That's that cursed island!
<wait 250>
Don't get mixed up with that
place, for your own sake...
<k> gor_00_05_08 I might as well tell you...
<wait 250>
My brother...<wait 250>went to Keelhaul
Key and never returned.
<k>
<p>
I get woozy just thinking of
it, but I've decided to work
up my courage and sail there.
<k> gor_00_05_09 My big brother came back,
safe and sound!
<k>
<p>
It's all thanks to you!
<wait 250>
Thank you, Mario!
<k> gor_00_05_10 My brother learned nothing.
<wait 250>
He's off somewhere else now...
<wait 250>
Doesn't he care about me?
<k>
<p>
I suppose if he wants to go,
it's not my place to stop him...
<wait 250>
But that's pretty weak.

Dearest Mario,
I have good news!

I don't know where I'm being

computer called TEC here.
<k>
<p>
By cooperating with this TEC,
I've managed to obtain some
of these fiends' data.
<k>
<p>
TEC is currently analyzing
it...and strange as it may
sound, I trust him.
<k>
<p>
Once his analysis is done, I
should be able to provide you
with details of their plans.
<k>
<p>
I'll e-mail you again once I
learn more. Be good, OK?

     The Night Before

<k>
<p>
I'm finally off tomorrow!
I've filled my pack with
cheese, and I'm ready to go!
<k>
<p>
My to-do list is crossed off.
I owe so much to all of my
investors... Not just money!
<k>
<p>
The old get-rich-quick
dream...but this is different.
I have a reason...
<k>
<p>
See, I owe it to my hometown.
It's so cold there, people
are constantly shivering.
<k>
<p>
If I find oil and send it
there, then people can use
it to heat their homes.
<k>
<p>
Oil will make me rich and
them happy. It seems to be
the perfect goal, right?
<k>
<p>
I have always, always...
had this dream, since I
was very small.
<k>
<p>
Of course, getting rich is
a big part of it, too, but
who doesn't want money?
<k>
<p>
Money! Money! Cover me with
it, please! Hahhhhhhhhhhh...
Well, enough for tonight...
<k> salari_after_010 <diary>

      The Buzzar Fiend
<k>
<p>
Why did it have to turn out
like this?
<k>
<p>
I got to Toad Town by boat,
then took a train to the
foot of Mt. Rugged.
<k>
<p>
Unfortunately, you can only
get from Mt. Rugged to
Dry Dry Desert on foot.
<k>
<p>
And tragedy waited for me
as I slogged faithfully up
that winding trail...
<k>
<p>
It was a huge, awful vulture!
I had read about it in my
travel brochures!
<k>
<p>
This Buzzar accosted all
travelers on Mt. Rugged!
<k>
<p>
I hightailed it, but Buzzar
had me in its sights.
<k>
<p>
I felt a piercing jolt as
its claws dug deep into my
backpack.
<k>
<p>
After dropping me onto a
cliff, Buzzar seemed to
forget me and disappear.
<k>
<p>
I let out a sigh of relief,
but when I touched my back,
I noticed my pack was gone!
<k>
<p>
My pack! In it was all my
food and money to start
the operation! No!
<k>
<p>
That mangy Buzzar made off
with everything of
importance to me!
<k>
<p>
All I have left is this
journal, a shovel to dig
for oil, and my life...
<k>
<p>
But perhaps living is
miracle enough...or so I'd
like to believe.
<k>
<p>
But now... I can't turn back.
I climbed down the mountain
to the desert.
<k>
<p>
The Dry Dry Desert sprawls
out before me, beckoning
dreamers and fools...
<k>
<p>
I am both, and I set out
with a heart full of dread...
<k> salari_after_011 <diary>

      A Helping Hand

<k>
<p>
I am now in a place called
Dry Dry Outpost.
<k>
<p>
Someone pulled me, lifeless
and parched, from the
merciless desert floor...
<k>
<p>
It was a Koopa with a fine
mustache named Kolorado.
An angel in a pith helmet...
<k>
<p>
He was a world-traveling
adventurer-archaeologist.
<k>
<p>
I told him about Buzzar...
<k>
<p>
And my quest for oil...
And my dreams of riches
and warmth for my people...
<k>
<p>
After I spoke at length,
he gave me food and water.
<k>
<p>
I asked him why he should
be so kind, and he looked
into the distance and said...
<k>
<p>
"Turning one's back on an
ambitious dreamer...
<k>
<p>
"Invites others to do the
same to you, old boy.
<k>
<p>
"I just... I just want to believe
in every dream this sad
old world can muster."
<k>
<p>
This guy, he still chases
his own dreams, dusty
dreams of archaeology.
<k>
<p>
We stayed up all night
discussing each other's
dreams. It was great.
<k> salari_after_012 <diary>

    A Reliable Guide

<k>
<p>
I am now at a desert oasis.
<k>
<p>
After Kolorado left, I set
out from Dry Dry Outpost to
find my digging point.
<k>
<p>
But the desert is so wide...
It's impossible to find
anything without a guide.
<k>
<p>
I had no idea where I was
going, and my head was
splitting in the heat.
<k>
<p>
My throat was burning and
scratchy... Was I awake?
Was I asleep?
<k>
<p>
I heard a voice calling to me
from far away...
<k>
<p>
"Hey, are you a nice guy?
If you're a nice guy, then
give me something nice."
<k>
<p>
I didn't have the food or
water I received from
Kolorado. I had nothing.
<k>
<p>
"Why do you lie here? If you
are a nice guy, give me a
nice thing, and I will help."
<k>
<p>
I croaked: "All I have is...
<k>
<p>

"All I have is my dream..."

<k>
<p>
When I next awoke, I was at
this oasis.
<k>
<p>
"You're awake!" I heard!
<k>
<p>
There was a Squeek there in
a gray head scarf.
<k>
<p>
"My name is Moustafa. You
had nothing to give, but I
got something nice anyway!"
<k>
<p>
I don't know how or why,
but it seems I'd been saved
by yet another stranger...
<k>
<p>
"Do you need a guide?
If there is somewhere you
want to go, I will take you."
<k>
<p>
Unbelievable! I've actually
found a reliable guide.
<k> salari_after_013 <diary>

     The Digging Point

<k>
<p>
We're here! I'm finally at
the spot where I'm supposed
to dig for oil!
<k>
<p>
I was told to draw a line
from a blue cactus to a
cactus-like rock...
<k>
<p>
I went north a precise
distance from the exact
termination point...
<k>
<p>
I ended up here, at a point
between Dry Dry Ruins and
the oasis...
<k>
<p>
Moustafa has guided me this
far with skill and bravery...
<k>
<p>
He said, "You are a nice guy.
Your dream will come true.
Moustafa believes this."
<k>
<p>
He left then, leaving me to
fight this battle on my own!
<k>
<p>
All I have to do is dig
here until I find oil.
That's all...
<k>
<p>
I stocked up on lemons and
limes at the oasis, so I
should last a few days.
<k>
<p>
I MUST find that oil!
<k> salari_after_014 <diary>

        The Long Dig

<k>
<p>
I am digging...for oil now, and...
my hand shakes...as I write
these...perhaps final...words...
<k>
<p>
I have been digging...from
sunup to sundown...but...still
no sign of...that sweet crude...
<k>
<p>
Maybe...I've just picked...
a dry spot...in this cursed
spot...in this cursed desert...
<k>
<p>
But...I'm sure this...is where
Merluvlee...told me to dig...
Yes...I'm sure of it...
<k>
<p>
There's...no more...food...or
water...and even my hopes...
have dwindled...to nothing...
<k>
<p>
Ahhh...this is it...my dream...
dies here...with me...under
these...unforgiving skies...
<k>
<p>
My...dream...
<k>
<p>
My...
<k>
<p>
My...?
<k>
<p>
Wait...no...this is not it...my
dream...is of something...else...
yes...something else...
<k>
<p>
Dig...
<k>
<p>

Keep...digging...
<k>
<p>


I...must...keep...digging...
<k>
<p>
...Arms...move...body...work...

        The Wrap-up

<k>
<p>
I am now on a boat back to
dear Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
I did it! I finally struck
oil in that dry desert!
<k>
<p>
I have left the day-to-day
operation to my men in the
field, and now return home.
<k>
<p>
It all came true... Striking
it rich... Finding oil...
My dream...
<k>
<p>
But...somewhere along the
way, this became more than
just my dream.
<k>
<p>
So many people have helped
to make this dream happen.
So many...
<k>
<p>
"You had nothing to give,
but I got something nice
anyway!" Dear Moustafa...
<k>
<p>
"I just want to believe in
every dream this sad world
can muster." Ah, Kolorado...
<k>
<p>
People who lent me money...
And gave me food... And
showed me the way...
<k>
<p>
So many hands reaching out
to help me...
<k>
<p>
I must do something for all
of them! That feeling has
pushed me even harder...
<k>
<p>
...I must share this feeling
with the people who helped
me as I struggled!
<k>
<p>
I must share these words
that have seared themselves
into my heart:
<k>
<p>
Dreams come true.

thinking about what to do
next, so say hi anytime.
<k> luigi_npc_04 I'm Hayzee!<wait 250> And I must say,
Luigi is a great actor, one
of the finest I've seen!
<k>
<p>
After this adventure, we're
going on tour to appear on
stages everywhere!
<k>
<p>
I'm going to be known as
"The Red Miracle"!<wait 250> And, of
course, Luigi will be grass!
<k> ep_01 So...<wait 250> You're leaving, then.
<k> ep_02 Well, that's too bad...
<k>
<p>
Having you around really did
wonders for my research...
<k> ep_03 Aw, Professor, we'd never let
you monopolize Mario for your
research, anyway!
<k>
<p>
Besides, you said I could be
your research assistant for
next term!
<k> ep_04 Hrmm... <wait 250>Yes, that's right.
<wait 250>
And I thank you, Goombella.
<k> ep_05 Mario...<wait 250> Even after you leave
here, please don't forget
about us, all right?
<k>
<p>
And we, in return, will wish
that you find all the best
in the future.
<k> ep_06 Never ever give up, Mario!
<wait 250>
That's the most important
thing I learned from you...
<k>
<p>
Thanks, Mario.<wait 250> Just promise
me you'll think of me now
and again, OK?
<k> ep_07 Ummm... <wait 250>Mario...<wait 250> Thanks to you,
I've found courage and
inner strength.
<k>
<p>
I don't know how to say this,
but...<wait 250>I think I like myself more
since I've known you...
<k>
<p>
And I feel like I've grown
closer to my dad.
<k>
<p>
It's all so hard to put into
words...<wait 250> Ummmmm...
<k> ep_08 My dear, dear Mario...
<wait 250>
I am ready to make my
comeback in the theater now.
<k>
<p>
I've found so many things
on this journey that I can
only express on stage...
<k>
<p>
And with these new themes...
<wait 250>
I am so ready for that
wonderful spotlight again!
<k>
<p>
Please do come see me once
we've finished rehearsing!
<wait 300>
And bring Peach too, dear! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k>
 ep_09 Gonzales...<wait 500> Oh, yeah, wait.
<wait 250>
I've gotta stop doing that.
<wait 250>
It's MARIO, right?
<k>
<p>
Well...<wait 250> You'll always be
Gonzales to me, man!
<k>
<p>
Because I was born in the
Glitz Pit, and Gonzales is, and
always will be, the champ!
<k>
<p>
So let's meet again, Gonzales!
<wait 250>
I mean it, man!
<k>
<p>


<wait 250><scale 0.67>                                         ...Sniff.
<k>
 ep_10 Uhhhh... <wait 250>Mario...<wait 250> I...<wait 250> I feel...
<wait 250>
I feel like I've grown to lo--
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
Uh, yeah, um, never mind...
<k>
<p>
...Y-Yeah, I sure do think that
you and Peach make a nice
couple... <wait 250>Hmm hmm hmm...
<k>
<p>
I...<wait 250> I'll never forget my
time traveling with you.
<k>
<p>
So...<wait 250> Don't forget me either...
<k> ep_11 Well, old boy...<wait 250> It was most
agreeable that I had the
chance to meet you...
<k>
<p>
If not for you, then my dear
Scarlette would still gaze
down on a broken Bob-omb...
<k>
<p>
But now, I'm off to sea again!
<wait 250>
I know Scarlette would have
wanted it that way...
<k>
<p>
Let's see each other again,
Mario!<wait 250> And this time, let it
be on the high seas, old boy!
<k>
 ep_12 Well, it is time for us to
part, my little cheese-hunk.
<wait 250>
But I will not say farewell.
<k>
<p>
Because...<wait 250> You're welcome
here anytime.
<k>
<p>
And since you're welcome,
you should come anytime
you please, sweetie!
<k>
<p>
Now, be careful...<wait 250>and until we
meet again...<wait 250>adieu.
<k>
 ep_13 Well, the boat's almost here...
<k> ep_14 <dynamic 3><scale 2.5>
MARIOOOO!
<k> ep_15 Ah, we made it just in time!
<k> ep_16 Take these with you!
<k> ep_17 We brought them so you'd
have something to eat on
the boat! <wait 250>Yummy!
<k> ep_18 These are VERY fresh
Mushrooms!
<k> ep_19 Yup!<wait 250> Here's one for Peach!
<k> ep_20 Oh, how lovely!<wait 250> Thank you!
<k> ep_21 <wait 200>
Everyone...
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<wait 100>
If not for all of you, the
world would have fallen into
a horrible darkness.
<k>
<p>
But your brave hearts strove
for peace...
<k>
<p>
...and saved this world!
<k>
<p>
I don't know how to thank
you...<wait 500>but know that the entire
world is in your debt!
<k>
 ep_22 What?<wait 250> Nonsense!<wait 250> We're the
ones who should be thanking
you, Princess!
<k>
<p>
If you hadn't come to our
little town...
<k>
<p>
We'd all be puppets for the
Shadow Queen and Grodus!
<wait 250>
The thought gives me hives!
<k> ep_23 Ah! <wait 250>Look! <wait 250>Your Highness!
<wait 250>
I see the boat!
<k> ep_24 Take care, everyone!
<wait 250>
Farewell!
<k> ep_25 Oh, forgive my lateness, sir!
<wait 250>
I must have dozed off a bit!
<k>
<p>
But please, come on board!
<wait 250>
I'll get you folks back at
full steam!!!
<k> ep_26 Set a course for the
Mushroom Kingdom!
<k> ep_46 <housou>
Well, I'm totally rambling at
this point, so I guess I'd
better wrap it up...
<k>
<p>
I just wanna say, even though
things got tough, I'm grateful
for our time together.
<k>
<p>
And... <wait 250>There is one thing that
kind of weighed on me and I
never got to express to you.
<k>
<p>
See, I...
<k>
<p>
Well... <wait 250>Maybe that's best kept
a secret.
<k> kpa_stg4_011 Haaaack... <wait 400>Oooooooog...
<wait 250>
A-CHOO! <wait 250>That was terrible...<wait 250> 
I gotta get in shape...
<k> kpa_stg4_012 <shake>
Who's...?<wait 200> WAAAAUGH!!!
<wait 250>
It's Bowser, the Koopa king!!!

He'll eat us!

<wait 1000> kpa_stg4_015 THERE you are, Lord Bowser!
<wait 250>
What are you doing here?
<wait 250>
I've been looking all over!
<k>
<p>
If I may ask, where have
you been, Your Sogginess?
<k> kpa_stg4_016 .<wait 250>.<wait 250>.Swimming.
<k> kpa_stg4_017 Really? <wait 250>Neat!<wait 250> As for me...<wait 250> 
Glitzville was <dynamic 3.0>FAN<wait 30>TASTIC!</dynamic><wait 250><wait 300> 
The fights were <dynamic 3.0>SO COOL!
</dynamic>
</wave>
<k>
<p>
I was overcome! <wait 250>Why, even
at my age, I was <wave>shaking

And then...<wait 250>the Hot Dogs!<wait 250> 
Oh, my gracious!<wait 300><wave> YUMMERLY!</wave> 
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
You have fun, too? Hm?

<wait 2000> kpa_stg4_019 Lord Bowser...<wait 250> Is that a "no"?
<k> kpa_stg4_020 It was terrible!<wait 250> You hear me?
<wait 250>
I swallowed a dang Blooper!
<wait 250>
I wanted to have FUN!
<k>
<p>
But forget it! <wait 250>It's over!
<k>
<p>
Go get me some solid info
on Princess Peach and the
Crystal Stars! <wait 250>NOW!!!<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Rogueport Harbor.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Ships come here from all
over the world!
<k>
<p>
Everybody's always working
their tails off down here.
<wait 250>
No wonder it's totally sweaty.
<k>
<p>
Sometimes this area's all
stacked high with cargo
from all the ships.
<k>
<p>
The water smells pretty rank,
but that's like, the magic
of a port town, y'know?
<k> モニー <keyxon>
That's Francesca the Pianta.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She's "well connected," get
me?<wait 300> Her dad's a big boss.
<k>
<p>
She doesn't crave money or
power or anything like that,
though.<wait 250> She lives for love.
<k>
<p>
Doesn't that, like, totally
melt your heart?<wait 250> People
could learn from this girl!
<k> ピートン <keyxon>
That's Francesca's boyfriend,
Frankie.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's the future of
the Pianta syndicate.
<k>
<p>
Hard to believe, isn't it?
<wait 250>
Still, he's the number-two
guy after Don Pianta.
<k>
<p>
You'd think he'd be this
tough guy, but Francesca has
him eating out of her hand.
<k> ガラの悪い水夫 <keyxon>
That's Pa-Patch the Bob-omb.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's a real salty sailor type.
<wait 300>
Totally active guy, huh?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, he looks pretty burly,
too.<wait 300> Gotta love strong
go-getters, huh?
<k> マルコ <keyxon>
That's the entrepreneur,
Flavio.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's like, super-rich.
<wait 250>
He owns lots of ships.
<k>
<p>
I don't know for sure, but
it looks like this ship
is his favorite.
<k> 水夫Ａ <keyxon>
By the sound of it, something
bad happened to this sailor,
and now he hates the sea.
<k>
<p>
Sounds so sad...<wait 250> I wonder
what he thinks about when
he looks out at the ocean...
<k> 水夫Ｂ <keyxon>
That's a Toad sailor who
works here at Rogueport
Harbor.
<k>
<p>
I hear he loves his family
so much that it's hard for
him to go on long voyages.
<k> 水夫Ｄ <keyxon>
That's one of the sailors
going with us to Keelhaul Key.
<k>
<p>
He seems super-motivated,
so we're totally lucky to
have him, know what I mean?
<k> めがね水夫 <keyxon>
They call that guy Four-Eyes.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's one of the sailors coming
with us to Keelhaul Key.
<k>
<p>
I totally feel like I've seen
him somewhere before,
though...
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
...Maybe I'm just going nuts.
<k> オドオド水夫 <keyxon>
That's a Toad sailor.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He seems pretty freaked out
to be a sailor, but hey.
<k>
<p>
I always hear him worrying
about his brother, so maybe
that's why he's so tweaked.
<k>
<p>
Y'know, speaking of which,
you don't exactly worry
about Luigi much, do you?
<k> オドオド水夫兄 <keyxon>
You know that sailor who's
constantly freaking out?
<wait 250>
That's his brother, there.
<k>
<p>
Talking to guys like this,
it seems like sailors always
want to get back to sea...
<k>
<p>
But they're pros, right?
<wait 250>
Do they really need to worry
about each other so much?
<k> 水夫ボム兵Ａ <keyxon>
That's Bomberto, a Bob-omb
sailor.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's small, but he's a
super-hard worker.
<k>
<p>
He doesn't just sail, either!
<wait 250>
He loads and unloads stuff,
too!<wait 250> Look at those muscles!
<k> 水夫ボム兵Ｂ <keyxon>
That's a Bob-omb sailor.
<wait 250>
He does basic harbor work,
like loading and unloading.
<k>
<p>
He's kinda gruff, but he seems
to have decent advice.
<wait 250>
Pretty OK guy, all around.
<k> 水夫ボム兵Ｃ <keyxon>
That's a Bob-omb sailor.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's one of the guys going
to Keelhaul Key with us.
<k>
<p>
Why do you think so many
Bob-ombs become sailors?
<wait 300>
Kinda weird, huh?
<k> コルテス <keyxon>
That's Cortez, remember?
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
The dread pirate ghost
feared by all? <wait 250>Ring a bell?
<k>
<p>
Boy, hard to imagine someone
that scary would like us...
<wait 300>
But he's just a big sweetie!
<k>
<p>
Plus, he's like our taxi
service between Rogueport
and Keelhaul Key! <wait 250>I love him!
<k> モコリム <keyxon>
That's Lumpy, a Ratooey.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
His dream is to strike it rich
by finding oil.
<k>
<p>
Gotta admire the dedication!
<wait 250>
Guys like this make me want
to chase my dreams harder! 
<k>
<p>
Still...<wait 250> When I talk to him, it
seems more like he's just up
for whatever, you know?
<k> サンダース <keyxon>
That's Admiral Bobbery.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
All the dock workers call him
a legendary helmsman.
<k>
<p>
I don't know if that's true,
but he definitely seems like
the most capable sailor here!
<k>
<p>
I know he's been through a
lot, but I'm glad we brought
him around, aren't you?
<k> 店長 <keyxon>
That's Thriff T. the Toad.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He and his brother run the
Toad Bros. Bazaar.
<k>
<p>
He says he wants to go to
Keelhaul Key to open his own
shop.<wait 250> Not a bad dream!
<k>
<p>
I get totally jealous of
people who stay so focused
on their goals, y'know?
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 300> How many customers
does he expect to get on a
deserted island, anyway?
<k> 店員 <keyxon>
That's one of the Toads
who's coming with us to
Keelhaul Key.
<k>
<p>
Sounds like she got tired of
life in Rogueport and wants a
fresh start on Keelhaul Key.
<k>
<p>
Hey, she's young, y'know?
<wait 250>
That's the time to get out
there and try new stuff!
<k> ボロドー２ <keyxon>
Whoa! <wait 250>Mario, that's the guy!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
That's Larson, the thief that
Goomther asked us to catch!
<k>
<p>
So this is where he's been
hiding!<wait 300> Let's nab him and get
the reward!<wait 250> C'mon!
<k> ルイージ <keyxon>
That's your brother, Loogie...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Wait, no! <wait 250>I mean, uh...Louie...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
No, I mean Luigi!
<k>
<p>
If you wonder what Luigi's
up to, I'm sure he'd tell you.
<wait 250>
All you gotta do is ask!
<k>
<p>
In fact, it kinda looks like
he's dying to tell you stuff,
so you oughta rap with him!
<k> ラクガン <keyxon>
That's Luigi's Dayzee friend,
Hayzee.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Apparently, Hayzee
is an actor/director.
<k>
<p>
You know Luigi's acting debut,
right?<wait 250> The grass thing?
<wait 250>
I could never play grass...
<k>
<p>
I'd wanna play a princess!
<wait 250>
And a prince would wake me
with a kiss...<wait 250> So romantic!
<k>  

mac_0_034_kur Wow, Mister!<wait 250> You...<wait 250>totally
saved me!<wait 250> Thanks!
<k> mac_0_034_00_kur I have just GOT to give you
a little reward!
<k> mac_0_035_kur My name's Goombella.<wait 250> I'm a
student at the University
of Goom.<wait 250> Nice to meet ya!
<k>
<p>
So, uh...<wait 250> Who are you?
<k> mac_0_036_kur <wait 100>
...Mario?<wait 250> Wait, you mean, like,
that famous guy?<wait 250> Wow! <wait 250>I
can't believe I met you here!
<k>
<p>
Cool...<wait 250> Anyway, no offense, but
it looks like you just rolled
into town yourself. <wait 250>Right?
<k> mac_0_037_kur Me, I already HATE it here!
<wait 250>
There are freaks and weirdos
EVERYWHERE!<wait 250> It's nasty!
<k>
<p>
I mean, I know the place is
called <col c00000ff>Rogueport</col>, so I should
have expected it, but sheesh!
<k>
<p>
I'd never come to a place like
this if there weren't some
legendary treasure here.
<k> mac_0_038_kur What? <wait 250>You're looking for the
<col c00000ff>legendary treasure</col>, too?
Seriously?
<k> mac_0_039_kur Whoa whoa WHOA, bucko!
<dkey><wait 250></dkey>
Whatcha got there?
<k> mac_0_040_kur Omigosh!<wait 250> Is... <wait 250>Isn't that a
treasure map?!<dkey><wait 250></dkey> You HAVE to
tell me where you got that!
<k> mac_0_041_kur ...Princess Peach? <wait 250>What?
<k> mac_0_042 <dynamic 3>Great hoogly-boogly!
</dynamic>
<dkey><wait 250></dkey>
If it isn't Master Mario!
<k> mac_0_043 Bit of a coincidence, bumping
into one another in this sort
of place, hm?<wait 250> Ho ho!
<k>
<p>
So tell me, Master Mario,
<dkey><wait 250></dkey>
what in the world brings you
to this wretched little burg?
<k> mac_0_044 ...Hmm? <wait 250>Ah!<wait 250> Indeed?!?
<dkey><wait 400></dkey>
Princess Peach sent you a
letter and a treasure map?
<k>
<p>
And she told you she'd meet
you here in Rogueport?!?
<wait 250>
Intriguing...
<k>
 mac_0_045 You're asking me where
Princess Peach is? <wait 250>Erm...
<dkey><wait 400></dkey>
I was about to ask you that.
<k>
<p>
We stopped in this town to
acquire a spot of fuel for
our ship, don't you know...
<k>
<p>
I only took my eye off her
for a moment, but as soon as
I did, she vanished.
<k> mac_0_046 You know how headstrong she
is, Mario...<wait 250> I just assumed
she'd be back momentarily...
<k>
<p>
But at this point, I fear we
must embrace the possibility
that she may never return.
<k>
<p>
I've been at a loss as to
what to do.<dkey><wait 500></dkey> I've been fraught
with worry, I tell you!
<k> mac_0_047 But I'm feeling better with
you here, Master Mario.
<wait 250>
Surely we'll find her!<wait 250> Surely!
<k>
<p>
But I know my place, Master
Mario...<wait 250>and this is not it.
<wait 250>
I leave this task to you.
<k> mac_0_047_01 I believe I'll recline in the
<col c00000ff>inn</col> right over there and
enjoy a spot of tea, perhaps.
<k>
<p>
In fact, I highly recommend it,
particularly if you find your
<col c00000ff>HP (Heart Points)</col> running low.
<k>
<p>
Just drop on INN!<wait 250> Ho ho!
<wait 1000>
...Yes, anyway, a little rest
there will fill all of your HP.
<k>
<p>
I must say, though, the rest
of this town is a bit...<wait 250>rough.
<wait 250>
Yes, rough, indeed...
<k> mac_0_047_01_01 Machi #111 mac_0_047_02 <small>
<scale 0.67>
Huff! I say...
<wait 300> mac_0_048_kur Um... <wait 250>Princess Peach?
<dkey><wait 250></dkey>
Did he mean, like, Peach, the
Mushroom Kingdom princess?!?
<k>
<p>
The princess who always gets
nabbed by Bowser, the Koopa
king?<wait 500> The one you rescue?
<k>
<p>
Wait a sec'!<wait 250> This is crazy!
<dkey><wait 250></dkey>
Princess...<wait 100>PEACH sent you
that treasure map?
<k> mac_0_049_kur Whoa. <wait 250>This is really intense.
<wait 500>
Well, where could she have
gone, then, do you think?
<k>
<p>
You think maybe she got sick
of waiting and went to find
the treasure on her own?
<k> mac_0_050_kur Oooh! <wait 250>Oooh!<wait 250> I know, Mario!
<wait 250>
Come with me!
<k>
<p>
One of my professors is here
researching that treasure.
<wait 250>
We'll show him your map!
<k>
<p>
If we start looking for the
treasure, then maybe we'll
catch up to Princess Peach!
<k> mac_0_051_kur Great!<wait 250> We're all good, then!
<dkey><wait 250></dkey>
Let's go, Mario!
<k> mac_0_053_kur First off, we gotta go find
my professor.
<k>
<p>
Thing is, since I just got to
town myself...<wait 250>I, um, don't
actually know where he lives.
<k>
<p>

<p>
Wait! <wait 250>Hold the horses!
<wait 250>
A great idea has struck!
<k> mac_4_013 Now that I am thinking of it,
I once heard of the treasure
of Cortez, the pirate king...
<k>
<p><dynamic 3>
Yes! <wait 250>This is the answer!
<wait 250>
Oh, such happiness for me!
<wait 250>
A hunt for pirate treasure!!!
</dynamic><k>
<p>
Why, that just shrieks of
rrrromance and thrills and
emotion and even money!!!
<k> mac_4_014 Do you not know the tale?
<wait 250>
The pirate king's treasure?
<wait 250>
Hidden on Keelhaul Key?
<k>
<p>
Ah! <wait 100>Well, tales say that the
pirate king, Cortez, hid his
hoard of pirate booty there.
<k>
<p>
For years, treasure hunters
and ruffians have gone there
in search of the loot...
<k>
<p>
But not a single one of them
has ever returned!<wait 250> Oh, the
horror makes my back tingle!
<k>
<p>
People here whisper that the
ghost of Cortez attacks all
who seek his treasure... <wait 250>Eek!
<k>
<p>
It is because of those very
rumors that people no longer
go to Keelhaul Key.
<k> mac_4_015 But that will not stop Flavio!
<wait 250>
That treasure is there, yes!
<wait 250>
And I am going to prove it!
<k>
<p>
For I am Flavio! <wait 100>Trader
extraordinaire, millionaire,
sailor of the seven seas!
<k> mac_4_016 What is that you are saying?
<wait 250>
You are also looking for a
treasure? <wait 100>Here in Rogueport?
<k> mac_4_017 Why talk such craziness?
<wait 250>
There isn't anything like that
in this dull armpit of a town.
<k>
<p>
You cannot be believing each
stupid rumor about treasure
some street urchin spews out.
<k>
<p>
No no no no no no no no NO!
<k> mac_4_018 Now what madness comes
bursting from your mouth?
<wait 250>
You have a treasure map?
<k>
<p>
W-Well... <wait 250>Hand it over!
<wait 250>
Rather, I mean, show me!
<k> mac_4_019 You are having a joke on me.
<wait 250>
This map leads straight to
Keelhaul Key!!!
<k>
<p>
You swine!<wait 250> You mean to steal
my treasure out from under
me, you awful, awful man!
<k> mac_4_020 Well, now I am confused.
<wait 250>
You are looking for things
known as the Crystal Stars?
<k> mac_4_021 But now that I am thinking...
<wait 250>
A star-shaped stone WAS
said to be in Cortez's hoard...
<k>
<p>
Perhaps I could sell it for
a staggering amount of cash?
<wait 250>
Yes, that would be...
<k>
<p>
...Ah! <wait 100>Stop such thoughts,
Flavio!<wait 250> What you need is
romance, thrills, and emotion.
<k>
<p>
I cannot ignore what this
business before me suggests...
<wait 250>
This must be fate at work!
<k>
<p>
Flavio shall go with you to
Keelhaul Key!
<k>
<p>
Of course, the Crystal Star
is yours!<wait 100> Yes!<wait 250> But the rest
of the treasure is mine!
<k> mac_4_022 Huh? <wait 250>You must repeat that.
<wait 250>
Flavio's ears are plugged.
<wait 250>
You have no ship?
<k>
<p><dynamic 3>
HA! <wait 100>HA!<wait 100> HA!<wait 100> HA!<wait 100> HA!<wait 100> HA!<wait 100> HA!

You unfortunate, foolish man!
<wait 250>

massive! <wait 100>And glorious!
<k> mac_4_023 Splendid, splendid, splendid!
<wait 250>
Let us begin preparations
immediately, shall we?
<k>
<p>
I will volunteer myself as
our intrepid leader! <wait 100>Yes!
<wait 250>
And you will be captain!
<k>
<p>
Ah! <wait 100>Danger and adventure
tickle my nostrils!<wait 250> Come to
the harbor right away!
<k> mac_4_046 Machi #777 mac_4_047 Admiral Bobbery?<wait 250> Yeah...
<wait 250>
Yeah, I know him.
<k>
<p>
You know that house just
past the wall in the eastern
part of town?<wait 250> That's his.
<k>
<p>
But I think both you and he
would be better off if you
just let him be...
<k> mac_4_061 You say Bobbery won't go to
sea, huh? <wait 250>Well, can't say that
surprises me.
<k>
<p>
The real question is, are you
folks REALLY sure you want
Bobbery back on the water?
<k> mac_4_062 Oh, is that it? Now I see...
<wait 300>
You want to mount an
expedition to Keelhaul Key...
<k>
<p>
Rough seas out there.<wait 100> Most
sailors would meet their ends.
<wait 300>
Not old Bobbery, though...
<k> mac_4_063 The fact of the matter is...
<wait 300>
Admiral Bobbery's tale is
sad. <wait 250>Horribly sad, actually.
<k>
<p>
You'll probably end up crying...
<wait 100>
but I'll tell it to you, if
you really want me to.
<o> mac_4_063_yesno <select 0 1 0 40>
Please do! I can take it.
No, I hate sad stories. mac_4_064 Ah...<wait 300> So, you've gotten up
the courage to listen to the
sad tale of Admiral Bobbery?
<o> mac_4_065 <p>
Well, fair enough, I suppose.
<wait 300>
I guess it isn't the sort of
story I should tell, anyway.
<k> mac_4_066 <p>
In that case, get ready...
<wait 300>
Bobbery's tale of woe goes
something like this...
<k> mac_4_067 Bobbery was once married.
<wait 250>
He had a wife of enduring
beauty named Scarlette.
<k>
<p>
The two of them were madly
in love, the sort of love
reserved for fairy tales.
<k>
<p>
Now, Bobbery was a renowned
sailor, so he was away from
home for long periods.
<k>
<p>
Scarlette never complained,
though, and always waited
faithfully for Bobbery's return.
<k>
<p>
And Bobbery... <wait 250>His eye never
drifted. <wait 100>He loved only
Scarlette, truly and deeply.
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
So they lived, and found
happiness where they could.
<wait 250>
And all was good, for a time...
<k> mac_4_068 ...But not all good things can
last. <wait 500>It was a particularly
icy winter when it happened...
<k>
<p>
Scarlette fell ill. <wait 250>A virus?
<wait 250>
A passing cold?<wait 250> No one knew,
but it soon turned serious.
<k>
<p>
Bobbery, at sea on a long,
lonely voyage, knew nothing
of his bride's suffering.
<k>
<p>
By the time he returned,
Scarlette had succumbed.
<wait 500>
She was gone.
<k>
<p>
Bobbery, of course, blamed
himself.<wait 250> "My loving wife
perished because of me..."
<k>
<p>
"If I were not at sea, I could
have nursed her to health.
<wait 250>
I could have saved her."
<k>
<p>
...He was overcome with such
thoughts. <wait 100>They tormented him
always, haunting his sleep.
<k>
<p>
He has never gone out to
sea since.
<k> mac_4_069_kur That's...<wait 100>sniff...<wait 100>the saddest tale
I've ever heard in my life.
<wait 250>
No wonder...
<k> mac_4_069_nok Oh, man... <wait 100>Now I'm depressed.
<wait 250>
So that's his reason...
<k> mac_4_069_win Oh, that poor dear! <wait 250>How
indescribably awful for him!
<wait 250>
Now I understand...
<k> mac_4_069_yos Gee... <wait 100>What a downer.
<wait 250>
I guess that's a pretty good
reason for hating the ocean...
<k> mac_4_069_viv I can't imagine what that
poor man went through...
<wait 250>
No wonder he won't sail...
<k> mac_4_069_chu Why must romance so often
end in tragedy? <wait 100>Why?!?
<wait 250>
I see why he won't sail...
<k> mac_4_070 You all know his tale now...
<wait 250>
So, tell me: <wait 50>do you still want
him to return to the sea?
<o> mac_4_070_yesno <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes... We have no choice.
No. He's suffered enough. mac_4_071 You wish him to sail again,
no matter the cost to him?
<wait 250>
No matter what it takes?
<o> mac_4_072 <p>
In that case, let the
miserable old soul be and
make your way without him.
<k> mac_4_073 <p>
Very well. <wait 250>I understand.
<wait 250>
If you're that determined,
then I'll give you this...
<k> mac_4_074 You got an old letter!
<k> mac_4_075 On her deathbed, Scarlette
wrote Bobbery a final letter.
<wait 250>
You hold it in your hands.
<k>
<p>
I don't know what's written
inside...<wait 250>but I can tell you what
she told me as she lay dying:
<k>
<p>
"If I should succumb to this
plague, and if my love should
blame himself for my death...
<k>
<p>
"Then give this letter to him,
so he may hear my voice."
<wait 250>
It was her last request.
<k>
<p>
But when I saw Bobbery in
misery, trying to forget the
pain as he mourned his wife...
<k>
<p>
I just couldn't bring myself
to present this letter to him.
<wait 250>
I've regretted it ever since.
<k> mac_4_076 Please...
<k>
<p>
Take this letter, and do the
deed I was too cowardly to
do: <wait 50>take it to Bobbery.
<k> mac_4_077_kur Thanks, Podley. <wait 250>And don't
beat yourself up for this.
<wait 250>
We'll deliver the letter.
<k>

<k> gor_01_cook_000 Oh,<wait 250> so it's you again, huh,
Mr. Stomp-a-lot?
<k>
<o> gor_01_cook_001 <p>
Well, my name is Zess T.
<wait 250>
I may not look like a chef,
but I'm actually quite good.
<k>
<p>
If you bring me ingredients,
my cooking skills burst to life
and culinary magic happens.
<k>
<p>
Want me to whip something
up for you right now?
<o> gor_01_cook_002 <p>
Want me to cook something
for you, Clumsy Crush-a-lot?
<o> gor_01_cook_003 Hey, Mr. Contact-Smoosher!
<wait 250>
Listen to this...
<k>
<p>
I got the lowdown on a book
that can turn anyone into a
master chef!
<k>
<p>
I went to the Trouble Center
in the east part of town and
recruited someone to find it.
<k>
<p>
If you like helping folks
out, you oughta swing by
there.<wait 250> I'll reward you!
<k>
<p>
So anyway...<wait 250> Did you need me
to cook something for you,
Dr. Bumblefoot?
<o> gor_01_cook_004 <p>
Well,<wait 250> shall I cook something
for you?
<o> gor_01_cook_005 <p>
Uh, listen, Captain Bungle...
<wait 250>
You don't have any
ingredients for cooking.
<k>
<p>
Unless you like eating air,
I suggest you pick some up
before you come back here.
<k> gor_01_cook_006 <p>
Oh,<wait 250> what a complete letdown.
<wait 250>
I thought I could put my skills
to the test...
<k> gor_01_cook_007 <p>
What ingredients would you
like me to cook with?
<k> gor_01_cook_008 What?<wait 250> Are you sure you don't
want me to cook anything?
<o> gor_01_cook_009 Want to use another
ingredient?
<o> gor_01_cook_010 Huh?<wait 250> What do you want
to do?
<o> gor_01_cook_011 Hey, hey!<wait 250> That's the same as
what you just gave me!
<wait 250>
Choose something different.
<k> gor_01_cook_012 <p>
OK, I'll cook up your
<wait 250>
%s!
<o> gor_01_cook_013 Heh heh!
<k>
<p>
Then I'll cook up your
%s and

<o> gor_01_cook_014 <p>
Huh?<wait 250> You want to stop?
<wait 250>
OK.<wait 250> Come back whenever,
Sir Stomp-on-Stuff.

did NOT turn out quite right.
<wait 250>
Hey, it happens.
<k>

No gor_01_cook_select <select 0 -1 0 80>
Just cook that.

Hmm. Wait just a moment.

while.<wait 250> Check back soon, OK?
<k> gor_01_014 Hey, fella, sorry, but your

<k> gor_01_026_07 I'm looking for this guy who
defrauded me with a fake
credit card the other day.
<k>
<p>
If you find that jerk, don't do
anything to him, understand?
<wait 250>
Just find him for me!
<k> gor_01_026_08 I was looking for this guy
who defrauded me with a
fake credit card...
<k>
<p>
But I quit looking for him.
<k>
<p>
Looking so hard for some guy
when the world was coming
to an end was pretty stupid...
<k>
<p>
Yeah, so I forgot about the
whole thumping-revenge thing.
<wait 250>
Heh heh heh heh heh!
<k> gor_01_027_00 You look like you don't know
nothing, so I'll teach you
something, how 'bout that?
<k>
<p>
If you press <icon PAD_Z_OFF 0.5 -22 34 -10>, you can check
your current HP.<wait 250> I can't
believe you didn't know that.
<k>
<p>
If you have low HP, you
oughta go rest in an inn so
you recover.<wait 250> Use your head.
<k> gor_01_027_01 You look like you don't know
nothing, so I'll teach you
something, how 'bout that?
<k>
<p>
If you gotta replenish both
HP and FP, inns are better
than recovery blocks.
<k>
<p>
Inns will refill all your Star
Power, too, that's why...
<wait 250>
Recovery blocks won't, genius.
<k> gor_01_027_02 You look like you don't know
nothing, so I'll teach you
something, how 'bout that?
<k>
<p>
In this town...<wait 250>the boss of
the Robbos and Don Pianta
are in a nasty turf war.
<k>
<p>
If you wanna live long, you'd
better either choose a side,
or stay the heck out of it.
<k> gor_01_027_03 You look like you don't know
nothing, so I'll teach you
something, how 'bout that?
<k>
<p>
Some people are so good at
fighting, they fight with
Stylish moves, you hear me?
<k>
<p>
I'm pretty sure that guy
who lives underground will
tell you about Stylish moves...
<k>
<p>
If you're interested, go talk
to that guy, 'cause I'm all
tapped out.
<k> gor_01_027_04 You look like you don't know
nothing, so I'll teach you
something, how 'bout that?
<k>
<p>
Here in Rogueport...<wait 250>there's a
world-famous archaeologist...
<k>
<p>
Huh?<wait 250> You already knew that?
<wait 250>
Fine, smart guy. <wait 250>I'll have
a better tip next time.
<k> gor_01_027_05 You look like you don't know
nothing, so I'll teach you
something, how 'bout that?
<k>
<p>
There's a world-famous sailor
named Bobbery here in
Rogueport who...
<k>
<p>
Huh?<wait 250> He's already with you?
<wait 250>
Fine, Mr. Big Brain. <wait 250>I'll have
a better tip next time.
<k> gor_01_027_06 You look like you don't know
nothing, so I'll teach you
something, how 'bout that?
<k>
<p>
There are secret blue pipes
below us that are connected
to other parts of the world.
<k>
<p>
If you find them, you'll be
able to go to distant places
like Poshley Heights instantly!
<k> gor_01_027_07 You look like you don't know
nothing, so I'll teach you
something, how 'bout that?
<k>
<p>
There are ruins beneath us,
and you can go down there
and find these pipes that...
<k>
<p>
Huh?<wait 250> You already knew that?
<wait 250>
Fine, Mr. Brilliant. <wait 250>I'll have
a better tip next time.
<k> gor_01_027_08 You look like you don't know
nothing, so I'll teach you
something, how 'bout that?
<k>
<p>
There's this guy named Mario
who saved the whole world
in its darkest hour...
<k>
<p>
Huh?<wait 250> YOU'RE Mario?!?
<wait 250>
W-<wait 250>W-<wait 250>W-<wait 250>Wait a sec'! <wait 250>Whoa!
<wait 250>
The rumors were all true?
<k> gor_01_028_00 Listen, this is a huge secret,
but I gotta tell someone...
<wait 250>
I'm a wanted Goomba.
<k>
<p>
I was a thief in another town
up until about three months
ago. <wait 250>Yeah, a good one.
<k>
<p>
But then the heat came
down and I needed to hide
out, so I came to Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
Now that I told you, you
gotta keep it a secret, OK?
<wait 250>
Heh heh... <wait 250>I'm so sly...
<k> gor_01_028_01 Listen, this is a huge secret,

Heh heh... <wait 250>I'm so slick...
<k> gor_01_028_02 Listen, this is a huge secret,

<wait 250>
I'm a wanted Goomba.

<wait 250>
I'm a wanted Goomba.

<k> gor_01_028_04 Listen, this is a huge secret,
but I don't mind telling you...
<wait 250>
I'm a wanted Goomba.
<k>
<p>
What?<wait 250> I'm not wanted by
anybody? <wait 250>...Really?
<k> gor_01_028_05 Listen, this is a huge secret,
but you seem like an OK guy...
<wait 250>
I'm a wanted Goomba.

<k> gor_01_028_06 Listen, this is a huge secret,

<wait 250>
I'm a wanted Goomba.
<k>
<p>
What?<wait 250> You're saying I don't
have to keep it secret?
<wait 250>
Are you nuts?
<k>
<p>
You don't know who I am!
<wait 250>
I'm such a huge thief, I once
robbed Bowser himself!
<k> gor_01_028_07 Listen, this is a huge secret,
but it's coming out, NOW...
<wait 250>
I'm a wanted Goomba.
<k>
<p>
What?<wait 250> You want to know
what I did that made me
come here to hide out?
<k>
<p>
Wh-Why?<wait 250> It's not like I stole
money from my parents and
got kicked out or anything!
<k> gor_01_028_08 Boy, I'm here for just the
stupidest reason... <wait 250>I mean,
who lives like this?
<k>
<p>
I'm gonna quit being a thief
and apologize to my parents.
<wait 250>
It's better to be a good kid...
<k> gor_01_029_00 Sniff! <wait 250>Sniff!<wait 250> You smell that?
<wait 250>
This smells like a profitable
situation, yes indeedy!
<k>
<p>
Looks like my star is finally
starting to shine...<wait 250>not that
it's any of your business.
<k> gor_01_029_01 Sniff! <wait 250>Sniff!<wait 250> You smell that?
<wait 250>
This smells like a profitable
situation, yes, indeedy!
<k>
<p>
Looks like my star is finally

<k> gor_01_029_02 Sniff! <wait 250>Sniff!<wait 250> You smell that?
<wait 250>
Something smells a little like
perfume, yes, indeedy-do.
<k>
<p>
You got someone in your
party who wears a lot of
perfume?<wait 250> Or is that you?
<k> gor_01_029_03 Sniff! <wait 250>Sniff!<wait 250> You smell that?
<wait 250>
Something smells like Hot
Dogs, yes, indeedy-doody!
<k>
<p>
Hey!<wait 250> Did you go eat at that
Hot Dog Stand in Glitzville?
<wait 250>
The one people talk about?
<k>
<p>
If you did...<wait 250>I'm jealous.
<k> gor_01_029_04 Sniff! <wait 250>Sniff!<wait 250> You smell that?
<wait 250>
Something smells like pig,
yes, indeedy-doink!
<k>
<p>
What's the deal, stinky?<wait 250> You
get a side job tending pigs
to raise a little extra dough?
<k> gor_01_029_05 Sniff! <wait 250>Sniff!<wait 250> You smell that?
<wait 250>
Something smells like low tide,
yes, indeedy-diddley!
<k>
<p>
Don't tell me you went out
to sea on a boat dressed like
that! <wait 250>You look like a plumber!
<k> gor_01_029_06 Sniff! <wait 250>Sniff!<wait 250> You smell that?
<wait 250>
Somebody smells filthy rich,

<p>
Don't tell me a guy dressed

Heights!<wait 250> That's ridiculous!
<k>

If you did, you'd better watch
your back.<wait 250> There are more

<wait 250>
Something doesn't smell quite
right, no, indeedy-don't.
<k>
<p>
I can't really place it...

I just got a really bad feeling,
like something really awful
is gonna happen soon...

<wait 250>
Me neither! <wait 250>No, indeedy!

<k>
<p>
Looks like good times may
be ahead, huh?
<k>
<p>
I'm not sure why, but
something tells me I ought to
thank you, bud. <wait 250>So, thanks.
<k> gor_01_030_00 ...
<k>
<p>
...
<k>
<p>
Can't you take a hint, pal?
<wait 250>
"..." means SCRAM!
<wait 250>
Don't talk to me!
<k> gor_01_030_01 ...
<k>
<p>
...
<k>
<p>
"..." means SCRAM!<wait 250> Don't talk
to me!<wait 250> My heart's burning
for my long-lost love.
<k>
<p>
Oh, Ms. Mowz, you sly, sultry,
little thief...<wait 250> I hope you're 
doing well, wherever you are.
<k> gor_01_030_02 ...

<k>
<p>
Oh...<wait 250> Where has my beloved
actress gone?<wait 250> Why did she
forsake me?
<k>
<p>
Yes, Flurrie was her name...
<wait 250>
She was skinny and toned,
<wait 250>
with a voice like an angel...
<k>
<p>
But she left the bright
lights behind and went off
to live in peace and quiet...
<k> gor_01_030_03 ...
<k>
<p>
...
<k>
<p>
"..." means SCRAM!<wait 250> Don't talk
to me!<wait 250> My heart's burning
for my long-lost love.
<k>
<p>
Yes, the reception Boo at the
parlor in the west part of
town...<wait 100> How is she, I wonder?
<k>
<p>
I'll never forget those eyes...
and the passionate secrets
that they hold.
<k> gor_01_030_04 ...
<k>
<p>
...
<k>
<p>
"..." means SCRAM!<wait 250> Don't talk
to me!<wait 250> My heart's burning
for my long-lost love.
<k>
<p>
Yes, I'm speaking of the
extraordinary beauty at the
juice shop in Glitzville...
<k>
<p>
No matter how many times I
flirted, she never paid me
the slightest attention...
<k> gor_01_030_05 ...
<k>
<p>
...
<k>
<p>
"..." means SCRAM!<wait 250> Don't talk
to me!<wait 250> My heart's burning
for my long-lost love.
<k>
<p>
I don't want to say this too
loudly, you understand...
<k>
<p>
But this blossom is the
daughter of Don Pianta.
<wait 250>
Francesca, the temptress...
<k>
<p>
I haven't seen her around
town lately. <wait 250>I hope she hasn't
eloped with another...
<k> gor_01_030_06 ...

<k>
<p>
"..." means SCRAM!<wait 250> Don't talk
to me!<wait 250> My heart's burning
for my long-lost love.
<k>
<p>
I've only ridden the Excess
Express once in my entire
life, you understand...
<k>
<p>
But I met an angelic waitress
in the dining car and gave
her a present.
<k>
<p>
I wonder if she's treasuring
that gift, the earring I gave
her out of purest love...
<k> gor_01_030_07 ...

<p>
...
<k>
<p>
"..." means SCRAM!<wait 250> Don't talk

<k>
<p>
I've been to Poshley Heights
only once in my entire life,
you understand...
<k>
<p>
But when I was there, I gave
a gift to a gorgeous madame
who lingered outdoors.
<k>
<p>
I wonder if she treasures
that gift, the silver ring I
gave her out of purest love...
<k> gor_01_030_08 ...
<k>
<p>
...
<k>
<p>
I don't think I'll ever love
again...<wait 250> As long as the world
is at peace, I'll be happy...
<k>
<p>
I think...<wait 250> Uh...
<k> gor_01_031_00 Oy. <wait 250>I used to sail around and
run wild in me younger days,
<wait 250>
but I'm a reformed sailor now.
<k>
<p>
I used to go 'round explodin'
all over the place without
givin' it much thought.
<k> gor_01_031_01 Oy. <wait 250>I used to sail around and
run wild in me younger days,
<wait 250>
but I'm a reformed sailor now.
<k>
<p>
I was blowin' up north, south,
east, and west back then.
<wait 250>
I was a real nutter!
<k> gor_01_031_02 Oy. <wait 250>I used to sail around and
run wild in me younger days,
<wait 250>
but I'm a reformed sailor now.
<k>
<p>
I used to blow up all the time
without payin' any heed to
wot ordinary blokes thought.
<k> gor_01_031_03 Oy. <wait 250>I used to sail around and
run wild in me younger days,
<wait 250>
but I'm a reformed sailor now.
<k>
<p>
But then I got to thinkin'...
<wait 250>
Is blowin' up a part of the
national Bob-omb identity?
<k>
<p>
Naw, I figured...<wait 250> There must
be lots o' blokes bein' all
Bob-omb-ish wifout blowin' up!
<k>
<p>
It was after I realized that
that I quit blowin' up all the
time.<wait 250> It was an eye-opener!
<k> gor_01_031_04 Fer a Bob-omb, blowin' up is
like throwin' a punch fer
an ordinary bloke...
<k>
<p>
If you wanna leave the
biggest impression, you gotta
do it wif perfect timin'.
<k>
<p>
Me mum said that once you
learn that timin', yer finally
an adult Bob-omb. <wait 250>Ah, Mum.
<k> gor_01_031_05 Once I learned proper timin'
for explodin', I started
thinkin' it was an art form!
<k>
<p>
But now I know:<wait 250> an explosion's
just an explosion, and there
ain't no way around it...
<k> gor_01_031_06 When I was a lad and blowin'
up all the time, some mates
I respected once told me...
<k>
<p>
"Explodin' without thinkin'
is like drinkin' coffee wifout
any cream.<wait 250> It's just wrong."
<k> gor_01_031_07 I sense a shadow fallin'
across this town, mate...
<k>
<p>
Now may be time fer me to
release all my pent-up
explosions, I'm thinkin'...
<k> gor_01_031_08 The moment that might 'ave
needed my explosions seems
to 'ave passed, eh?
<k>
<p>
When that sky filled up with
darkness, I was so shook I
almost exploded on the spot!

thing quick.
<k>
<p>
Take this package to
Goomfrey. <wait 250>You'll find him
in front of Frankly's place.
<k>
<p>
And try not to be seen.
<k> irai_02_01 What's the matter with you?
<wait 250>
Hurry up and deliver it!
<k>
<p>

<wait 250>

<k> irai_02_02 Did you deliver it? <wait 250>Phew!
<wait 250>
You saved my neck, buddy.
<k>
<p>
Oh!<wait 250> I almost forgot your
compensation.<wait 250> You saved my
neck.<wait 250> You get something good.
<k> irai_04_001 Hey!<wait 250> You're here to handle
my trouble, aren't you?
<wait 250>
Then listen up!
<k>
<p>
Larson the Bandit pulled
some credit card fraud on
me and took my dough.
<k>
<p>
I want to rough him up for
it, but the guy is too wise,
and I can never catch him.
<k>
<p>
He's hiding somewhere here
in Rogueport, so I want
you to find him.
<k>
<p>
By the way, Bandits are
those guys in blue outfits
who wear masks.
<k>
<p>
There are several in
Rogueport,<wait 250> but this one will
fess up once you grill him!
<k>
<p>
Do this, and then you'll
get your reward.<wait 250> I'm counting
on you!
<k> irai_04_002 Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
<wait 250>
Did you find Larson?
<k>
<p>
The guy's on the verge of
giving himself up, so don't
worry about what he'll do.
<k>
<p>
Just keep after him until
you catch him.
<k>

Just keep hitting me in the

You really helped me!

Well, now!
<k>
<o> irai_16_00 Mmm hmm hmm hmm hmm...
<wait 250>
Hi, Mr. Mustache-Cutie!
<wait 250>
I'm the one with the trouble.
<k>
<p>
Mmm... <wait 250>I'm a pretty lucky girl
to have a strapping fellow
like you take on my trouble.
<k>
<p>
Well, let me get right to
it, OK?
<k>
<p>
I've done all I can to find
this one elusive badge, but
I've failed at every turn.
<k>
<p>
The badge is hidden in
Hooktail's lair, of that
much, I'm sure.
<k>
<p>
I went to check that room
after I heard you defeated
Hooktail, but...<wait 250>nothing.
<k>
<p>
I did hear rumors that to
find this badge, one has to
use the wind...
<k>
<p>
I have no idea what that
means, though...<wait 250> Anyway,
look for it, OK, sweetie?
<k> irai_16_01 The elusive badge is hidden
in Hooktail's lair.
<k>
<p>
And I hear you need the
power of wind to find it.
<wait 250>
What could that MEAN?
<k>
<p>
Well, will you look for it?
<wait 250>
I'm counting on you, sweetie.
<k>
 irai_16_02 Mmmm hmm hmm hmm hmm...
<wait 250>
That face...<wait 250> Does it mean you
found the badge?
<k> irai_16_03 Well, this is certainly the
badge that I was looking for.
<wait 250>
Oh, my, yes!
<k>
<p>
Mmm hmm hmm...<wait 250> Now, my
sweet...<wait 250> Promise to hear me
out without getting mad.
<k>
<p>
You see... <wait 250>I was the one who
hid that badge...<wait 250> It was a
little game of mine.
<k>
<p>
I have to apologize...
<k>
<p>
But I knew you would find it.
<wait 250>
My handsome cheese-hunk...
<k>
<p>
You may have even more
badge-finding skill than I do.
<k> irai_16_04 Hm!<wait 250> I just thought of
something.
<k>
<p>
Perhaps I should just travel
with you from now on...
<k> irai_16_05 Because, hmm hmm, I'm sure
to find lots of badges that
way, don't you think?
<k>
<p>
Now about that reward...
<wait 250>
Let's see...
<k>
<p>
Take this badge that you
managed to find...<wait 250>but I expect
you to lead me to more!
<k>
<o> irai_16_05_1 <p>
Hm! <wait 250>You can't hold any more
badges, can you...
<k>
<p>
...Well, that's kind of rude.
<k> irai_16_05_2 I left the badge for you in
front of the badge shop.
<k>
<p>
Just go pick it up when you
have some room, sweetie.
<k> irai_16_06 Now, let me formally state...
<wait 250>
that you will now enjoy the
pleasure of my company.
<k> irai_18_001 Hey. <wait 250>You took on my trouble?
<wait 250>
Well, it's really important,
so listen up, Mr. Klutz.
<k>
<p>
Ages ago, there was this
great, legendary chef named
Maitre Delish.
<k>
<p>
Rumor has it, you instantly
become a better chef by
reading his book. 
<k>
<p>
Unfortunately, it's an old
book that's hard to find...
<wait 250>
Stores don't carry it...
<k>
<p>
But I've recently heard that
someone who used to live in
Creepy Steeple had a copy! 
<k>
<p>
There are many secret rooms
in Creepy Steeple, so it's
moldering there somewhere...
<k>
<p>
I just HAVE to get my hands
on that book and read it!
<wait 250>
Help me out, Stumblebum!
<k>
<o> irai_18_002 Did you find that cookbook?
<k>
<o> irai_18_003 AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
<wait 250>
That's it!<wait 250> That's the book by
Maitre Delish!
<k>
<p>
Give it here, quick!
<k> irai_18_004 ...<wait 250>Ha!<wait 250> I... <wait 250>I see! <wait 250>...Ah-hah!
<k> irai_18_005 I've got it now!
<k>
<p>
Just glaze a Mushroom with
Honey Syrup...<wait 250>for a yummy
Honey Shroom! <wait 250>Brilliant!
<k>
<p>
Now I can use recipes that
require two ingredients!
<k>
<p>
Now that's SOME book...
<wait 250>
Talk about effective!
<k>
<p>
Thanks, Mr. Staggers!
<wait 250>
Take this as your reward!
<k>
<o> irai_18_006 <system>

You got the Honey Shroom!
</system> irai_18_006_1 <p>
...Or I COULD have given you
a reward, but you have too
much stuff!
<k>
<p>
I'll just leave it here,
so grab it whenever!
<k> irai_18_007 Now I can use recipes that
require two ingredients,
so just ask me anytime!
<k>
<p>
I'm really going to put my
soul into it and cook with a
vengeance from this day on!
<k> irai_18_008 <p>
Well, that's too bad...
<wait 250>
But I'm sure you'll find it
eventually.
<k>
<p>
It's in a secret room in
Creepy Steeple...<wait 250> And hey...
<wait 250>
You roll around, don't you?
<k>
<p>
Well, try rolling up in
Creepy Steeple next time,
to help your search!

Soooo...<wait 250>then.
<k>
<o> irai_20_027 Welcome to Podley's Place,

lives and drama, if you will.

<wait 250>
What is it, Mario?<wait 250> Tell me!
<wait 250>

<k> irai_20_029 ...But perhaps you could tell
this Eve person something?
<wait 250>
Tell her...<wait 250> Live in the moment.
<k>
<p>
And is that all you needed?
<wait 250>
Because I'm a little busy.
<k> irai_20_030 <small>

<wait 800> irai_20_031 Is that all you needed?
<wait 250>
Because I'm a little busy.
<k> irai_25_00_1 General White?
<wait 250>
Yeah, I spoke to him just
a second ago, actually.
<k>
<p>
We're old buddies, he and I.
<k>
<p>
I've known him since he was
a little snapper that would
explode over any little thing!
<k>
<p>
Then again, I was the kind
of guy that would bonk
people for smiling funny...
<k>
<p>
Still, he turned out to be a
fine Bob-omb, though he
never cured that wanderlust!
<k>
<p>
I'm pretty sure he said he
was off to Glitzville next.
<k>
<p>
I go back pretty far with the
guy that runs the juice shop
there, too.
<k>
<p>
So give him my best!

the badge shop in Rogueport,
so she's happy.
<k>
<p>
She comes over to Frankly's
sometimes to visit...
<k>
<p>
But, as usual, as soon as she
sets foot outside the shop,
she turns into a badge-ninja.
<k>
<p>
She said just the other day
that she had found some
super-rare badge, actually.
<k>
<p>
That's our globe-trotting,
mystery-making, flirting,
little badge thief, huh?

<wait 500> kpa_stg6_003 Grrrrmph...<wait 250> Hrrrgh...<wait 250> Bluh.
<wait 250>
I've got no Crystal Stars...
<wait 250>
I can't find Princess Peach...
<k>
<p>
Twilight Town was...<wait 400> Well, it
wasn't exactly glorious. 
<wait 300>
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?!?
<k>
<p>
If this keeps up, Mario's
gonna steal everything from
my grasp! <wait 250>AS USUAL!!!
<k> kpa_stg6_004 Your Massiveness!
<k> kpa_stg6_005 We did it! <wait 250>The Magikoopa
scouts found a suspicious
underground chamber!
<k>
<p>
It isn't even on any maps!<wait 250> 
Yeah!<wait 250> REALLY suspicious!
<wait 250>
SOMETHING must be there!
<k> kpa_stg6_006 Hmph! <wait 250>About time!<wait 250> Well done!
<wait 250>
This is where it all turns
around for me! <wait 250>Definitely!
<k> kpa_stg6_007 The Hammer Bros. battalion
is attempting to breach the
chamber at the moment...
<k>
<p>
The area is impenetrable!<wait 250> 
They're scrapping tooth
and nail in there!
<k> kpa_stg6_008 No problem!<wait 250> Direct me there!
<wait 250>
I'll blast us through!<wait 250> 
<wave>I'm Bowser, baby!</wave>
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Rogueport's main
square.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> It's sorta the central
shopping area, I guess.
<k>
<p>
There are lots of regular
working folks here, but
there are also ne'er-do-wells...
<k>
<p>
If you venture into the back
alleys, be ready to deal
with some nasty sorts...
<k> バッジ店長 <keyxon>
That's the badge manager at
the Lovely Howz of Badges.
<k>
<p>
For a manager, she sure is
gone from the store a lot...
<wait 300>
Where do you think she goes?
<k>
<p>
This shop's small, but it's
totally adorable.<wait 300> She really
knows how to decorate.
<k> バッジ店員 <keyxon>
That's the badge clerk that
works part-time here at
the Lovely Howz of Badges.
<k>
<p>
It sounds like he really wants
to open his own badge shop
someday.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, I think he's using this
job to learn the business!
<wait 300>
Talk about motivation!
<k> 店長 <keyxon>
That's Plenn T., the manager
of the Toad Bros. Bazaar.
<k>
<p>
He originally opened this
store with his brother,
Thriff T.
<k>
<p>
Those two guys...<wait 250> I can never
tell them apart, y'know?
<wait 300>
They're totally identical.
<k> 店員 <keyxon>
Toad Bros. Bazaar is run by
a pair of Toad brothers.
<wait 300>
This one's Thriff T.
<k>
<p>
They must get along really
well to be able to run a
shop together, y'know?
<k>
<p>
...But then again, you and
Luigi are pretty tight, too,
right?<wait 250> You guys ever fight?
<k> ナンシー <keyxon>
That's Zess T., a super-
skilled Toad chef.
<k>
<p>
With the right ingredients,
she can make ANYTHING!
<wait 300>
She's like a kitchen magician!
<k>
<p>
I am like, a TOTAL klutz in
the kitchen, so I really
respect a chef's touch.
<k> キノじい <keyxon>
That's Toadsworth, steward
of Princess Peach's castle.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's an active senior!
<k>
<p>
He's been really worried
since Peach went missing...
<wait 300>
I hope we can mellow him out.
<k> マスター <keyxon>
That's the innkeeper, Podley.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He looks distinguished, always
polishing those glasses...
<k>
<p>
I wouldn't mind having a
cold Chuckola Cola sometime
and listening to him talk...
<k>
<p>
He opened this inn a long
time ago, so he really knows
about the townsfolk.
<k> マルコ <keyxon>
That's the entrepreneur,
Flavio.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's like, super-rich,
and he owns lots of ships.
<k>
<p>
What's he doing in here so
early in the day, though?
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Think he's doing OK?
<k> 宿店員 <keyxon>
That woman runs the inn.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She's sweet and helpful,
unlike most Rogueporters.
<k>
<p>
If your HP and FP get too
low, come here to get them
restored with a night of rest.
<k> ロテン１ <keyxon>
That's a lazy Doogan.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He hunts shady "jobs" that
he expects to pay well.
<k>
<p>
I bet he's never done an
honest day's work in his life.
<wait 250>
What a piece of work.
<k> ロテン２ <keyxon>
That's a suspicious Doogan.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He craves that one big score,
but I doubt it'll happen.
<k>
<p>
I mean, even if he did make
some money, he'd just blow it.
<wait 250>
He depresses me...
<k> クリボー１ <keyxon>
That's Goomther the Goomba.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's always grumbling about
getting ripped off...
<k>
<p>
...He must be easy to con.
<wait 250>
Which isn't to say that we
should con him, of course!
<k> クリボー２ <keyxon>
That guy's a local Goomba.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He'll give you advice and
stuff, so he's OK.
<k>
<p>
His tips totally might come in
handy, so you oughta talk to
him as often as possible.
<k> クリボー３ <keyxon>
That's McGoomba.<wait 250> A Goomba,
obviously.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> I think maybe he's
on the lam from somewhere.
<k>
<p>
I mean, why else would he
be chilling in this back
alley?<wait 250> It's nasty here!
<k> チューさん１ <keyxon>
That guy's Mousimilian.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He sniffs out propositions
that might make him loot.
<k>
<p>
With his nose for opportunity,
he could really do well in the
straight business world...
<k>
<p>
But I guess no one in
Rogueport is really cut out
for the suit-and-tie life...
<k> チューさん２ <keyxon>
That guy practically lives
here... <wait 250>He must like it, huh?
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's like, the ultimate regular.
<k>
<p>
As far as I can tell, he's
recounting the tales of every
love of his life, one by one.
<k> 水夫ボム兵 <keyxon>
That guy's a Bob-omb sailor.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I think he comes here every
time his ship makes port.
<k>
<p>
I don't blame him. <wait 250>This place
has totally cool atmosphere.
<wait 250>
I'd be a regular, too...
<k> ボッタクール <keyxon>
That guy's Charlieton.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's a salesman from way
far away.
<k>
<p>
His prices are steep, but he's
normally got rare items and
pretty unusual badges.
<k>
<p>
He might even have a few
completely unique items that
he dug up somewhere...
<k> ルイージ <keyxon>
That's your brother, Loobie...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Wait, no! <wait 250>I mean, uh...Loofa...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
No, I mean Luigi!
<k>
<p>
If you wonder what Luigi's
up to, I'm sure he'd tell you.
<wait 250>
All you gotta do is ask!
<k>
<p>
In fact, it kinda looks like
he's dying to tell you stuff,
so you oughta rap with him!
<k> 盗賊 <keyxon>
That's a bandit who's made
this place his hideout.
<k>
<p>
Seems like he totally loves
this place...<wait 250>but would it kill
him to clean up a bit?
<k> チュチュリーナ <keyxon>
That's Ms. Mowz, the thief.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Hmph. <wait 250>She jets off to exotic
places to find rare badges.
<k>
<p>
She's only like, the biggest
flirt I've ever met in my
entire life! 
<k>
<p>
It's weird that she's the
anonymous requester of
the super-secret badge...
<k> ボロドー２ <keyxon>
Whoa! <wait 250>Mario, that's the guy!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
That's Larson, the thief that
Goomther asked us to catch!
<k>
<p>
So this is where he's been
hiding!<wait 300> Let's nab him and get
the reward!<wait 250> C'mon!
<k> キック <keyxon>
That's Luigi's Blooper friend,
Blooey.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> It's totally weird to
find Bloopers on dry land.
<k>
<p>
He seems peeved, though...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I wonder why he looks all
fried to a golden crisp?
<k> トルク <keyxon>
That's Luigi's pal, Torque.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I hear he's like, a totally
excellent mechanic.
<k>
<p>
According to Mechanics
Weekly...<wait 250>that tool on his back
can basically do anything.
<k>
<p>
He seems ticked off, though.
<wait 250>
I wonder what happened?
<k> キック２ <keyxon>
That's Luigi's Blooper friend,
Blooey.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> It's totally weird to
find Bloopers on dry land.
<k>
<p>
He seems jolly to be fried to
a golden crisp, though...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Did something good happen?
<k>  

mac_0_062 Oops! Pardon me, sucker!
<wait 750> mac_0_063_kur Hey! <wait 250>What's your beef, pal?
<wait 250>
YEAH, I'M TALKING TO YOU!

<k> mac_0_067 Ah.<wait 250> Yes.<wait 250> You.<wait 250> Now, you, uh...

I've seen your face before...
<wait 250>
Yes, that face...
<k>
<p>
Wait for it...<wait 250> Just a moment...
<wait 250>
Don't tell me, now! <wait 250>Silence!
<wait 250>
I'll get it right!
<k> mac_0_067_01 Umm...<wait 250> It's not Goombriel...

Errrrmmm...
<k> mac_0_067_05 <dynamic 3>
A-HAAA!</dynamic> I've got it!!!
<k> mac_0_067_06 <dynamic 3>
You're Goombella, aren't you?
</dynamic><wait 250>
You were in my archaeology
class last year, am I right?
<k> mac_0_068_kur Wow, yes, sir! <wait 250>That's me!
<wait 250>
I'm Goombella, a junior at
U Goom!<wait 250> Goooo GOOMBAS!
<k> mac_0_069 Of course I remember you.
<wait 250>
Not to toot my horn, but I'm
pretty good at remembering.
<k>
<p>
You, though... <wait 250>You stick out in
my mind because you were
such an exceptional student.
<k>
<p>
And that guy behind you is...
<k> mac_0_069_01 <dynamic 3>
<scale 2.3>
WHO?!?
<k> mac_0_069_02 Mario! <wait 250>Professor, he's Mario!
<wait 250>
You know...<wait 250>the famous one!
<k> mac_0_069_03 Oh! My apologies.<wait 250> I'm such a
bookworm, I haven't a clue
about what's "hip" right now.
<k>
<p>
In any case, what sort of
errand brings you two all
the way to a place like this?
<k> mac_0_070_kur We were hoping you'd tell us
about the legendary treasure
said to be below Rogueport!
<k>
<p>
I thought that if anyone
knew anything about it, you
would, Professor Frankly...
<k> mac_0_071 Of course I know about it.
<wait 250>
The reason I came here was
to study that very subject.
<k>
<p>
But why do you tykes want
to learn about the legendary
treasure?
<k>
<p>
You know that most say it's
little more than a fairy
tale, don't you?
<k> mac_0_072_kur Archaeologists and historians
have to search for truth in
those fairy tales, though!
<k>
<p>
Me, I believe the legendary
treasure truly does exist!
<wait 250>
And I REALLY want to find it!
<k> mac_0_073 <wait 150>
Good point! <wait 250>And well made!
<wait 250>
In that case, I'll cooperate
with you however I can.
<k>
<p>
First of all, about the
treasure...<dkey><wait 350></dkey> There are many
mysteries surrounding it.
<k> mac_0_073_01 Some say it's an infinitely
vast treasure hoard, while
others say it's a magical item.
<k>
<p>
Some books say it's actually
a monster, while still others
claim it's an empty chest...
<k>
<p>
So many different theories...
<wait 250>
Obviously, it's impossible to
divine the truth among them.
<k>
<p>
...But all agree on one point:
<wait 250>
to find the treasure, one
must have <dkey><wait 350></dkey>the <col c00000ff>Crystal Stars</col>!
<k> mac_0_074_kur "To find the treasure of yore,
take the seven Crystal Stars
to <col c00000ff>the Thousand-Year Door</col>!"
<k>
<p>
...You mean the Crystal Stars
in that old saying that super-
elderly people pass down? 
<k> mac_0_075 Indeed, the same.<wait 250> As the
saying goes, if you want to
find the legendary treasure...
<k>
<p>
You first must collect the
seven Crystal Stars.
<k> mac_0_076_kur "Hold the <col c00000ff>Magical Map</col> aloft
before the entrance to
the Thousand-Year Door.
<k>
<p>
"Then the stars will light the
way that leads to the stones
of yesterday." <wait 250>Yeah...
<k>
<p>
A lot of the lore I've read
says that if this Magical Map
is taken to the doorway...
<k>
<p>
...then it'll show you where
to find the Crystal Stars!
<k> mac_0_077 <dynamic 3>
Correct!</dynamic><wait 300> And the Thousand-
Year Door is supposedly here,
deep beneath this town.
<k>
<p>
Yet the critical piece of the
puzzle--the Magical Map--is
lost.<wait 300> If only we had that map!
<k> mac_0_078_kur But we DO have it, Professor!
<wait 500>
Or... <wait 250>Well, not "we," exactly...
<wait 250>
MARIO has the Magical Map!
<k> mac_0_079 <dynamic 3><scale 2.5><shake>
WHAAAT???

Hummina hubbity hubbida

huffala hoofala...<wait 250> REALLY?
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
You...<wait 250> You actually have it?
<wait 250>
Could I...<wait 250>just take a quick look
at it, if you don't mind?
<k> mac_0_080 <dynamic 3>
Astounding! <wait 250>This is it!
<wait 250>
The real thing! <wait 250>The one and
only Magical Map!
<k> mac_0_081 <dynamic 3>You, son, are my HERO!
<wait 250>
You're great!<wait 250> Fantastic!
<wait 250>
WONDERFUL, even! 
</dynamic 3>
<k>
<p>
With this...
<k>
<p>
We can find the Crystal Stars
just by holding this aloft
before the legendary door!
<k> mac_0_081_01_kur Right on, Professor!
<k> mac_0_082 Good golly, what are we doing
just sitting here, then?!?
<wait 250>
Goombella!<wait 250> Mario!
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>
Off we must go, this instant!
</dynamic>
<wait 250>
Let's take the Magical Map
to the legendary door!
<k> mac_0_083 I bet you didn't know this
rotten old thing came off,
did you? <wait 250>Heh heh!
<k> mac_0_084 We can use this pipe to get
down under the city streets!
<k>
<p>
Come on! <wait 250>Both of you!
<wait 250>
Let's get moving!
<k> mac_0_084_01 Oh, wait, hang on a second...
<wait 300>
Mario! <wait 250>Something just
occurred to me.
<k> mac_0_084_02 I'm fairly certain there are
quite a few hoodlums below.
<wait 250>
So, uh...<wait 250>keep your guard up.
<k>
<p>
You two do know about your
<col c00000ff>Action Commands</col>, don't you?
<o> mac_0_084_02_yesno <select 1 1 0 40>
Of course!
Nope. mac_0_084_03 <p>
Really? <wait 250>A master, are you?
<wait 250>
Maybe you ought to practice
them once, just to be safe?
<o> mac_0_084_03_yesno <select 0 1 0 40>
OK, fine.
No thanks, I'm good. mac_0_084_04 <p>
A bold young lad, aren't you!
<wait 250>
Very well, then!<wait 250> Down we go!
<k>
<p>
Just stand on the pipe and
tilt <icon STICK 0.6 -30 45 -10> <col c00000ff>Down</col> to enter it.
<k> mac_0_084_05 <p>
Hmmph!<wait 250> Positively shocking! 
<wait 250>
In that case, you ought to
take a second to learn them.
<k>
<p>
We'll have a little practice
session. <wait 250>Goombella,<wait 250> you can
be Mario's opponent.
<k> mac_0_084_06 What?!?<wait 100> Me? <wait 250>Are you nuts?!?
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
Oh, gee, ummmmmm... <wait 250>Uh,<wait 100> OK.
<wait 250>
I'll do my best, I guess!
<k> mac_0_b_t2_000 First, we'll practice the Jump
Action Command.<wait 250> That OK
with the both of you?
<k>
<p>
Choose the Jump command,
then choose which enemy
you'll attack.
<k> mac_0_b_t2_001 When you choose your target,
the Action Command details
appear down below, there.
<k> mac_0_b_t2_002 There! <wait 250>Right there, Mario!
<wait 250>
Just before you land on your
enemy, press <icon PAD_A 0.6 -20 34 -10> again.
<o> mac_0_b_t2_003 You'll know you did it right
when "NICE" appears.<wait 250> You can
do more damage this way!
<k> mac_0_b_t2_004 Now it's your turn to attack,
Goombella. <wait 250>Shake a leg!
<k> mac_0_b_t2_005 OK...<wait 250> Here goes, Mario!
<k> mac_0_b_t2_006 Hold up! <wait 250>Right there, Mario!
<wait 250>
Press <icon PAD_A 0.6 -20 34 -10> just before your enemy
strikes you.
<o> mac_0_b_t2_007 You did a <col c00000ff>Guard</col> Action
Command!<wait 250> Guarding well will
reduce the damage you take!
<k>
<p>
But listen: you can't just
repeatedly tap <icon PAD_A 0.6 -20 34 -10> to guard.
That...<wait 250>will not work.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and remember this:<wait 250> the
Action Commands change
depending on the attack.
<k>
<p>
Better stay on your toes!
<wait 250>
Anyway, next let's practice
Hammer Action Commands.
<k> mac_0_b_t2_008 Once you choose the enemy
you're going to attack, Mario,
<wait 250>
tilt and hold <icon STICK 0.6 -30 45 -10> Left.
<o> mac_0_b_t2_009 Keep holding <icon STICK 0.6 -30 45 -10> Left, now!
<wait 250>
Don't let go!
<o>
 mac_0_b_t2_010 Release <icon STICK 0.6 -30 45 -10> as soon as the <icon AC_ON 0.6 -20 34 -10> 
lights up.
<wait 250>
<o> mac_0_b_t2_011 Another rousing Action
Command success!
<k>
<p>
How did that feel, Mario?
<wait 250>
Got a pretty good grasp on
Action Commands now?
<k> mac_0_b_t2_012 Excellent. <wait 250>Now for a real
treat: I'll teach you a
really incredible technique!
<k>
<p>
Goombella,<wait 250> try to attack
Mario one more time.
<k> mac_0_b_t2_013 You got it, Professor!
<k> mac_0_b_t2_014 Freeze right there, Mario!
<wait 250>
This time, press <icon PAD_B 0.6 -20 34 -10> just before
the enemy attack lands.

Yeeeowch!
<wait 500> mac_0_b_t2_016 See? <wait 250>You turned the foe's
attack back on him!<wait 100> I mean,
her!<wait 250> That's a <col c00000ff>Superguard</col>!
<k>
<p>
If you do a Superguard with <icon PAD_B 0.6 -20 34 -10>,
you take no damage...<wait 250>AND
damage your enemy in return.
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250>Superguards are harder
to do than standard <icon PAD_A 0.6 -20 34 -10> guards.
<wait 250>
Choose wisely between them.
<k> mac_0_b_t2_017 And that concludes Action
Commands 101!<wait 150> Har har har!
<wait 150>
Sorry... <wait 250>Professorial humor.
<k>
<p>
How'd that go over? <wait 100>Would
you like to practice your
Action Commands a bit more?
<o> mac_0_b_t2_018 <select 0 1 0 40>
Yeah.
Nope, got it! mac_0_b_t2_019 <p>
Smart move. <wait 250>It takes hard
work to fully master all the
different Action Commands.
<k>
<p>
Whenever you want to quit
practicing, just choose the
Quit command.
<k> mac_0_b_t2_020 <p>
I expected nothing less,
Mario!<wait 250> You're a quick learner!
<wait 250>
You're already a pro, I'm sure!
<k> mac_0_b_t2_021 Nicely done, Mario!
<wait 250>
Excellent Action Command!
<wait 250>
That was perfect timing!
<k> mac_0_b_t2_022 Oh!<wait 250> That was so close, Mario!
<wait 250>
You were just a little early
that time.
<k> mac_0_b_t2_023 Oh! <wait 250>That was so close, Mario!
<wait 250>
Your timing was just a little
late! <wait 250>Almost, though!
<k> mac_0_b_t2_024 OK.<wait 250> Maybe we should stop
practicing for now.
<k> mac_0_084_07 Well, I do believe now we're
all set for our quest, hmm?
<wait 250>
So down below we go!
<k>
<p>
Hop up onto the pipe and tilt
<icon STICK 0.6 -30 45 -10> <col c00000ff>Down</col> to enter the pipe.
<k> mac_0_085 Come now!<wait 250> I simply can't wait!
<wait 250>
Let's go down underground!
<wait 250>
Quickly, now!
<k>
<p>
Hop up onto the pipe and tilt
<icon STICK 0.6 -30 45 -10> Down to go into it.
<k> mac_0_102 Hrmmm...<wait 250> Aha! I see!
<k> mac_0_103_kur You understand it, Professor?
<k> mac_0_103_01 My dear, of course I do!
<wait 250>
Firstly, about that light we
saw shining on Mario...
<k>
<p>
By my reckoning, Mario can
now perform what is known as
a <col c00000ff>special move</col>.
<k> mac_0_103_02_kur A special move?
<k> mac_0_103_03 Yes, it... <wait 100>Well...<wait 250> Stuff like this
is better explained by
example rather than words.
<k>
<p>
Would you like to try it out?
<o> mac_0_103_03_yesno <select 0 1 0 40>
Sure thing.
No thanks. mac_0_103_04 <p>
This is VERY important.
<wait 250>
You'd better listen.<wait 250> I mean it.
<wait 250>
Are you ready to listen?
<o> mac_0_103_05 <p>
Excellent!<wait 250> In that case, we'll
go outside, since this place
is a little cramped.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_000 First, take a close look at
your Star Power gauge.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_001 You'll see that your gauge
has one power dot.<wait 250> Obviously
that's a single unit of power.
<k>
<p>
So you're sitting on a
single dot of Star Power.
<wait 250>
With me so far?
<k>
<p>
When you have Star Power
available, you can use a
special move.
<k>
<p>
Try using Sweet Treat now.
<wait 250>
It's a special move that will
replenish your HP and FP.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_002 Machi #294 mac_0_b_t3_003 Since you used one power
dot, the Star Power gauge
is now empty.<wait 250> Take a look.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_004 Even if the gauge empties
out, though, you can still
charge it up again.
<k>
<p>
That's why the audience
watching your battles is so
very important.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_005 If you can get the audience
excited, you'll build up more
Star Power.
<k>
<p>
Let me show you what I
mean.<wait 250> Mario,<wait 100> Goombella...
<wait 250>
Try to attack me, please.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_006 Nice! <wait 250>See that?<wait 250> You thrilled
your audience, so they filled
up some of your gauge.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_007 Nice! <wait 250>Keep building up that
Star Power.
<k>
<p>
Also, the more exciting your
battles are, the more people
will come to watch you fight!
<k>
<p>
As you can see, that's
reflected in the number of
members in this audience.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_008 That won't do.<wait 250> Perform like
that and the audience will
feel ripped off, trust me.
<k>
<p>
You have to execute your
Action Commands! <wait 250>Don't get
stage fright, now!
<k> mac_0_b_t3_009 That's no good!<wait 250> Come on!
<k>
<p>
If you don't perform your
Action Commands, people will
stop coming to see you.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_010 Not quite!<wait 250> Keep trying!
<k> mac_0_b_t3_011 Mario! <wait 250>This is your chance
to hit it big!
<k> mac_0_b_t3_012 Nail an Action Command when
you have two matching icons
and icon wheels appear.
<k>
<p>
Give it a try!
<k> mac_0_b_t3_013 Fantastic!<wait 250> You matched
three icons!
<k>
<p>
When you match those icons,
the crowd goes nuts and
people swarm the theater.
<k>
<p>
Plus, depending on the icons
you match up, your HP, FP, or
Star Power will fill up.
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250>if you get three Poison
Mushrooms, something terrible
will happen, so be careful.
<k> mac_0_b_t3_014 Still with me?<wait 250> The more
people in your audience, the
more Star Power you can get.
<k>
<p>
You can also use the <col c00000ff>Appeal</col> 
command to get Star Power.
<wait 250>
I hope you memorized all this!
<k> mac_0_b_t3_014_1 Great Goomba's ghost!<wait 250> Mario!
<wait 250>
Look at your audience!
<k> mac_0_b_t3_014_2 Does that guy have a...
<wait 250>
hammer? <wait 250>He DOES, the bum!
<wait 250>
He means to toss it at you!
<k> mac_0_b_t3_014_3 If the audience members hit
you with anything, you'll
take damage, obviously.
<k>
<p>
You have to press <icon PAD_X_ON 0.5 -20 35 -10> to stop
them before they hit you.
<o> mac_0_b_t3_014_4 That's right! <wait 100>Sweet justice!
<k>
<p>
You can press <icon PAD_X_ON 0.5 -20 35 -10> to protect
yourself from the objects the
audience throws at you.
<k>
<p>
Of course, fans of yours might
toss good stuff, like coins...
<wait 250>
Don't attack them!
<k> mac_0_b_t3_015 Well, that's all I've got!
<wait 250>
Here ends my scintillating
lecture on special moves.
<k>
<p>
Let's go back inside.
<k> mac_0_103_06 <p>
Hmm... <wait 250>You're absolutely sure?
<wait 250>
Well, all right, then.
<k>
<p>
Let's have a look at that
Magical Map and see what
we can learn about the...
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>
WOW! <wait 250>ASTOUNDING!
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
This map has radar-like
functions! <wait 250>It now shows the
location of a Crystal Star!
<k>
<p>
It looks like the first Crystal
Star is to be found in a place
called the <col c00000ff>Petal Meadows</col>.
<k> mac_0_104 Let's have a look at that
Magical Map and see what
we can learn about the...
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>
WOW! ASTOUNDING!
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
This map has radar-like
functions! <wait 250>It now shows the
location of a Crystal Star!
<k>
<p>
It looks like the first Crystal
Star is to be found in a place
called the <col c00000ff>Petal Meadows</col>.
<k> mac_0_105_kur Petal Meadows?
<k> mac_0_106 Yes. <wait 250>The area is a vast
meadow that lies far to the
east of Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
To tell you the truth...
<wait 250>
I've always thought that
place was a tad suspicious.
<k>
<p>
The name Petal Meadows did
come up from time to time in
my research.
<k> mac_0_107_kur OK, fine.<wait 100> So we'll go there.
<wait 250>
Does anybody know how to
get there or what?
<k> mac_0_108 I'm fairly certain that
somewhere beneath the city
is a pipe to Petal Meadows.
<k>
<p>
If you could just find that,
you'd get there instantly.
<wait 250>
Pipe travel's efficient!
<k> mac_0_109 Say, by the way, Mario...
<wait 250>
I'm curious. <wait 100>Where did you
get that map, anyway?
<k> mac_0_110 From Princess Peach?<wait 100> Really?
<wait 250>
Her Highness sent this to
you, Mario?
<k>
<p>
This Princess Peach...
<wait 250>
This wouldn't be
her, would it? <anim c_peach P_Z_1 350 55 3.0 0>
<k> mac_0_111 <dynamic 3>
<scale 2.5>
So it IS her!
</scale>
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
Your princess came to see me
the other day.<wait 250> She wanted
to learn about the treasure...
<k>
<p>
I told her about the Crystal
Stars and my suspicions
about Petal Meadows...
<k>
<p>
It doesn't seem likely, but
perhaps she tried to go to
Petal Meadows on her own...
<k> mac_0_112_kur Y'know, Professor, there
was another suspicious group
asking about the same thing.
<k> mac_0_113 <wave>Hrmm...</wave><wait 250> But I can't imagine
Princess Peach getting
involved with THEM...
<k> mac_0_114 <dynamic 3>
All right! It's settled!
</dynamic>
<wait 250>
Off to Petal Meadows you
two go!
<k>
<p>
If Princess Peach indeed
went there, your first priority
must be to catch up to her.
<k>
<p>
Collecting the Crystal Stars is
a means to an end...<wait 100>and that
end is Princess Peach!
<k> mac_0_117_kur Aren't you coming, Professor?
<k> mac_0_118 No, I'll stay in town and ask
around about Princess Peach
and that suspicious gang.
<k>
<p>
Besides, I doubt a shriveled
old Goomba like me could
handle the trials of the road.
<k>
<p>
Of course, if anything
happens and you need some
advice, come see me, OK?
<k> mac_0_119_kur You got it, Professor!
<k> mac_0_120_kur Well, Mario, <wait 250>we're off!
<k> mac_0_121_01 <dynamic 3>
Wait just a moment!
<k> mac_0_121_02 Mario, it's scary out there. 
<wait 250>
Take this with you.
<k>
<p>
It's called a <col c00000ff>badge</col>, and it
is incredibly helpful.
<k>
<p>
You see, depending on the
badges you have equipped,
you'll get much more powerful.
<k>
<p>
What's important is knowing
what the effects will be when
you first equip a badge.
<k>
<p>
Would you like to practice
equipping and removing
badges?
<o> mac_0_121_02_yesno <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes, please.
No, thanks. mac_0_121_03 <p>
Are you absolutely sure?
<wait 250>
This is the last time I'll ask.
Do you want practice?

<p>
In battle, you should watch
not only your HP, but FP, too.
<wait 300>
Did you get all that?
<k>
<p>
Well, here's hoping you find
that pipe to Petal Meadows.
<k> mac_1_000 Oh! Galloping Goombas!
<wait 250>
You got a Crystal Star!!!
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>Magnificent</dynamic>, Mario!
<wait 250>
I knew you could do it.
<k>
<p>
First you must take that
down to the Thousand-Year
Door.<wait 250> Then we'll talk.
<k> mac_1_004 Hrmm...<wait 250> Mmmm HRRRRMMMM...
<k> mac_1_005 I see, I see. <wait 250>Crystal clear!
<k> mac_1_006_kur Yeah, great pun. <wait 100>C'mon!
Where's the next Crystal
Star, Professor?
<k> mac_1_006_nok Um... <wait 100>So, can you tell us
where the next Crystal Star
is or not?
<k> mac_1_007 It's in the Boggly Woods.
<wait 250>
The second Crystal Star is
inside a great tree there.
<k> mac_1_008_kur A great tree in the Boggly
Woods? <wait 100>OK...
<k> mac_1_008_nok A great tree in the Boggly
Woods, huh?
<k> mac_1_009 About those woods...
<wait 250>
I think...<wait 250>some odd
creatures live there.<anim c_puni Z_1 350 50 6.0 0> 
<k>
<p>
If memory serves, there's a
pipe beneath town that leads
to those woods.
<k> mac_1_010_kur By the way, Professor...
<wait 250>
About Princess Peach...
<k>
<p>
Not long ago, Mario received
an e-mail from her.
<k>
<p>
It said that the people who
kidnapped her are also
looking for the Crystal Stars.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and the worst part?
<wait 250>
She said that she doesn't
even know where she is!
<k> mac_1_010_nok Um... Professor Frankly...
<wait 250>
You should probably know...
<wait 250>
It's about Princess Peach...
<k>
<p>
Mr. Mario got an e-mail
from her just recently.
<k>
<p>
Her Highness said that the
guys who kidnapped her are
also hunting Crystal Stars.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and she said she doesn't
even know where she's being
held. <wait 250>...Yeah.
<k> mac_1_010_01 Uh-oh. If Princess Peach's
kidnappers are also looking
for the Crystal Stars...
<k>
<p>
What could they hope to
achieve?<wait 250> Could the treasure
be...<wait 250> Ugh! Too many unknowns!
<k>
<p>
Unfortunately, the only clues
we can rely on are the
Crystal Stars and that map.
<k> mac_1_010_02_kur Then we'll head for Boggly
Woods to find the next
Crystal Star! <wait 100>Let's do it!
<k> mac_1_010_02_nok Um...<wait 100> I guess all we can do is
head to Boggly Woods to find
that next Crystal Star!
<k> mac_1_010_03 Yes, I recommend you do just
that.<wait 250> And find it before the
princess's captors do!
<k>
<p>
But don't be hasty!<wait 100> If you're
low on items or health, drop
by the shop and inn first.
<k>
<p>
I'll keep researching to learn
more about the Crystal Stars
and the ancient treasure.
<k> mac_2_000 Oh!<wait 250> So you managed to get
the Crystal Star from Boggly
Woods without much trouble?
<k>
<p>
Well, I've learned several
vital things, but first, go to
the Thousand-Year Door.
<k> mac_2_002_01 ...That means that beneath
this town, the thousand-year-
old ruins remain intact.
<k> mac_2_002_02 And that door's been sealed
shut for a thousand years
by the Crystal Stars...
<k>
<p>
In order to open that seal,
we have to muster the power
of all the Crystal Stars.
<k> mac_2_002_03_kur But the question is, why did
they seal the legendary
treasure away to begin with?
<k>
<p>
I mean, were they just trying
to keep it from being stolen,
or what?
<k> mac_2_002_03_nok But, um... <wait 100>Why would they
need to seal the treasure
away in the first place?
<k>
<p>
You think maybe they just
wanted to protect it from
thieves and robbers?
<k> mac_2_002_03_win Perhaps I'm just daft, but
why would they want to seal
this treasure away at all?
<k>
<p>
Did they fear thieves and
brigands? <wait 100>If not, then what?
<k> mac_2_002_04 No, that's not...
<k> mac_2_002_05_kur ...What? <wait 100>That's not WHAT?
<k> mac_2_002_05_nok That's not what?
<k> mac_2_002_05_win Hm? <wait 100>That's not what?
<k> mac_2_002_06 <dynamic 3><scale 2.2>
I don't KNOW!
<k> mac_2_002_07_kur Sheesh, Professor...
<k> mac_2_002_07_nok Whoa, Professor Frankly!
<k> mac_2_002_07_win Frankly, please!
<k> mac_2_002 I'm sorry.<wait 250> So sorry!
<k>
<p>
I know that the treasure was
sealed away around the time
the town was destroyed...
<k>
<p>
But the problem is... <wait 100>No one's
even sure what it was that
caused the town's demise.
<k>
<p>
All that's written is this:
<wait 100>
"Darkness stole the sky and
the cataclysm rained down."
<k>
<p>
I must research this more.
<wait 250>
Assuming will just make an...
<wait 250>
Well, you know the saying.
<k> mac_2_003_kur No, I don't, but whatever.
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
How about this next Crystal
Star, then? <wait 100>It's like it's
floating on the Magical Map...
<k> mac_2_003_nok Oh, yeah, right...
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
Anyway, what about the next
Crystal Star? <wait 100>It looks like
it's floating on that map!
<k> mac_2_003_win Oh, yes.<wait 400> How inappropriate.
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
In any case, what about the
location of this Crystal Star
that's floating on the map?
<k> mac_2_004 Hmm... Very interesting...
<wait 250>
Perhaps it's pointing to the
floating town of <col c00000ff>Glitzville</col>...
<k>
<p>
There's a stunning arena
there where great warriors
engage in furious battles!
<k>
<p>
Ostensibly, families go there
on vacation to lounge and
enjoy the fights, but...
<k>
<p>
Behind the scenes, the
richest people in the world
wager on the bouts.
<k> mac_2_005_kur It's, like...floating?
<k>
<p>
Well, how are we supposed to
get there, then?
<k> mac_2_005_nok Um... <wait 100>If it's a floating city...
<k>
<p>
How the heck are we
supposed to get there?
<k> mac_2_005_win A floating city, you say?
<k>
<p>
So, are we just supposed to
sprout wings and fly there,
darling?<wait 250> Do tell.
<k> mac_2_006 A special blimp flies there...
<wait 250>
It departs from Rogueport
several times a day.
<k>
<p>
The problem is getting a seat.
<wait 250>
The only way to get a ticket
is through certain "channels"...
<k> mac_2_007_kur What?<wait 100> What "channels"?
<wait 100>
Stop being mysterious!<wait 100> How
do we get seats on the ship?
<k> mac_2_007_nok Well, that doesn't sound hard.
<wait 250>
Anyone can use these
"channels," right? <wait 400>Right?
<k> mac_2_007_win Oooh! <wait 100>That sounds exciting!
<wait 100>
A little...on the seedy side.
<wait 100>
Show me the way!
<k> mac_2_008 Hrmmmmmmm... <wait 100>I don't know...
<wait 100>
But I guess we don't have
much choice.
<k>
<p>
Word on the street is, all
tickets go through Don
Pianta on the west side.
<k> mac_2_009 Head west from Rogueport's
main plaza and you'll reach
the west side of town.
<k>
<p>
That part of town is under
the control of Don Pianta,
the Pianta syndicate head.
<k>
<p>
Apparently, Don Pianta
makes pretty regular jaunts
over to Glitzville.
<k> mac_2_010_kur So, no problem!<wait 100> We'll just go
meet this Don Pianta guy,
and we'll be on our way!
<k> mac_2_010_nok Well, hey, that sounds easy!
<wait 250>
We just have to talk to this
Don Pianta person.
<k> mac_2_010_win Mmmm... <wait 100>I like the sound of
this Don Pianta fellow. <wait 100>I
cannot WAIT to meet him!
<k> mac_2_011 It may sound easy, but he's
a syndicate boss, folks.<wait 100> The
rumors about him are scary.
<k>
<p>
And Don Pianta is a recluse.
<wait 250>
Just getting an audience
with him will be difficult.
<k> mac_2_012 You want somethin', chump?
<wait 250>
This is the fortress of the
Robbo Thieves.<wait 100> You lost?
<k>
<p>
What business brings a chump
like you to a place like this?
<wait 100>
Say it ain't vacation.
<k> mac_2_013 Whazzat?
<k>
<p>
You wanna meet that lyin',
cheatin', stealin', no-good
jerky-for-brains, Don Pianta?
<k> mac_2_014 Real thieves like us end up
poor as dirt, never catchin'
a break 'cause of that guy.
<k>
<p>
Did you come here knowin'
all that?
<k> mac_2_015 And you know that scumbag
demands protection money
from us too, yeah?
<k>
<p>
You know all that and you
STILL want us to tell you how
you can meet that crumb?
<k> mac_2_016 What?<wait 250> You gotta be kiddin'
me.<wait 100> Am I hearin' you right?
<wait 100>
I coulda sworn you said...
<k>
<p>
You REALLY want me to tell
you how to meet Don Pianta.
<wait 400>
The scum of the earth.
<k> mac_2_017 Fine, Mr. Insensitive Jerk...
<wait 250>
But it'll cost you 64 coins!
<k>
<p>
And no budgin' on the price!
<wait 100>
Not a single coin! <wait 250>Inside info
is pricey! <wait 100>Them's the breaks!
<o> mac_2_017_yesno <select 0 1 0 80>
OK, I'll pay.
Forget you, pal! mac_2_018 <p>
Y-You'll pay? Really?
<o> mac_2_018_yesno <select 0 1 0 40>
Yeah, you heard me!
Uh...no. mac_2_019 <p>
YESSSSS!!!<wait 150> I mean... <wait 250>Good call.
<wait 100>
You're a shrewd businessman.
<wait 250>
64 coins, on the nose.
<k> mac_2_020 <p>
You don't have enough cash!
<wait 250>
You dirty cheat!<wait 250> You can't
pull a fast one on this snail!
<k>
<p>
Please!<wait 250> Come back after you
knock over a bank or
something, chump!
<k> mac_2_021 <p>
WHAT?!?<wait 250> Are you gonna pay
me, or are you not gonna pay
me? <wait 100>Make up your mind!
<k>
<p>
Come back once you get
your priorities straight,
Chumpie!
<k> mac_2_022 <p>
WHAT?!?<wait 250> Oh, fine, I get it.
<wait 100>
Don't wanna pay, huh?
<k>
<p>
Fine!<wait 250> No pay, no way, I say!
<wait 250>
Come back when you're ready
to stop being a cheapskate!
<k> mac_2_025_yesno <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No mac_2_038 OK, then clean those ears
out and listen here...

<k> mac_3_000 I can tell by the look on
your face that you got the
next Crystal Star.
<k>
<p>
What was that?<wait 250> Something
outrageous was written in
Princess Peach's e-mail?
<k>
<p>
Clearly there's much to talk
about, but only after you go
<wait 250>
to the Thousand-Year Door.
<k> mac_3_001_01 <scale 2.5><dynamic 3><shake>
WHAAAT???
<k> mac_3_001_02 The group that kidnapped
Princess Peach is bent on
total world conquest?!?
<k> mac_3_001_03_kur It sure sounds like it!
<wait 250>
That must be why they need
the legendary treasure, huh?
<k> mac_3_001_03_nok Yes, sir!<wait 250> And we figure that
would be why they need the
ancient treasure.
<k> mac_3_001_03_win Correct, dearie.<wait 250> And that,
you see, is why they need
that legendary treasure...
<k> mac_3_001_03_yos Uh-huh! <wait 100>You got THAT right!
<wait 250>
That's why those jerks need
that legendary treasure!
<k> mac_3_001_04 Hrmm...<wait 100> This doesn't bode well.
<wait 250>
The situation has gotten far
more serious than I thought!
<k> mac_3_001_05 Let me bring you up to speed.
<wait 250>
I've been researching just
what this treasure could be...
<k>
<p>
One book I came across held
to what I thought was a
preposterous theory...
<k>
<p>
This book claimed that the
"treasure" was, in actuality,
the great cataclysm.
<k>
<p>
...The very cataclysm that, a
thousand years ago, sank
that town underground!
<k> mac_3_001_06_kur Wait a sec'! <wait 250>So they wanna
use that cataclysm's power
to take over the world?!?
<k> mac_3_001_06_nok S-So those guys want to use
the power of that...<wait 100>ulp...
<wait 100>
cataclysm to rule the world?
<k> mac_3_001_06_win So these fiends plan to use
the power of the cataclysm
to control the world?
<k> mac_3_001_06_yos So these jerks think the
power of that cataclysm will
help them rule the world?!?
<k> mac_3_001_07 I can't say for sure what
they will do or why, but we
must consider the possibility.
<k>
<p>
Now that things have come
to this, we mustn't let them
near the legendary treasure.
<k>
<p>
That's all that matters.
<wait 100>
Because if they do get it,
then once again, this town...
<k>
<p>
No...<wait 100>the ENTIRE WORLD could
be destroyed!
<k> mac_3_001_07_kur Oh my GOSH, Professor!
<wait 250>
Then we gotta get the next
Crystal Star right away!
<k> mac_3_001_07_nok Um...<wait 100> In that case, Professor...
<wait 250>
We need to find that next
Crystal Star! <wait 50>And FAST!
<k> mac_3_001_07_win In that case, Frankly...
<wait 250>
We must procure that next
Crystal Star, quickly!
<k> mac_3_001_07_yos Then out with it, Prof!
<wait 250>
We gotta find that next
Crystal Star, super-quick!
<k> mac_3_002 Hrmm...<wait 250> According to the map,
it appears the next Crystal
Star is in <col c00000ff>Twilight Town</col>.
<k> mac_3_003_kur Twilight Town?
<k> mac_3_003_nok Twilight Town?
<k> mac_3_003_win Twilight Town?
<k> mac_3_003_yos Twilight Town?
<k> mac_3_004 To tell you the truth, I don't
know much about the place,
myself.<wait 250> Only rumors.
<k>
<p>
I have heard that, as the
name implies, it's perpetually
dim and eerie there.
<k>
<p>
...Wait just a moment...
<k> mac_3_005 Ah-HA!<wait 250> There appears to be
a pipe to Twilight Town
somewhere here in Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
I do believe it's somewhere
underneath the west part of
town.<wait 250> Yes, definitely.
<k>
<p>
If you get stuck for any
reason, just come back and
see me again, OK?
<k> mac_3_006_kur Beneath the west part of
town! <wait 100>Gotcha! We're on it!
<wait 250>
Thanks, Professor.
<k>
<p>
Wooo! <wait 250>All right, Mario!
<wait 250>
Let's do it!
<k> mac_3_006_nok The west part of town?
<wait 100>
Underground? <wait 100>Okeydokey!
<wait 250>
Thank you, Professor!
<k>
<p>
Well, Mario...<wait 250> I guess we should
leave posthaste!
<k> mac_3_006_win Below the western part of
town? <wait 100>Very well, then!
<wait 250>
Cheers, Frankly! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k>
<p>
Come along now, Mario!
<wait 250>
We go at once!
<k> mac_3_006_yos Under the ground in the west
part of the town?<wait 100> Check!
<wait 250>
Gotcha, Prof!
<k>
<p>
C'mon, Gonzales! <wait 100>Let's go!
<wait 250>
Time to break out!
<k> mac_3_007_kur Professor!<wait 250> We found the pipe
and tried to go through, but
we got pushed back out!
<k> mac_3_007_nok Ummmmm...<wait 100> Hey, Professor?
<wait 250>
We tried going into that pipe,
but we got spat back out...
<k> mac_3_007_win Frankly!<wait 250> We went into that
blasted pipe, but something
pushed us right back out!
<k> mac_3_007_yos Hey, Prof!<wait 250> The pipe's a no-go!
<wait 100>
We went in, but we got
pushed right back out!
<k> mac_3_008_kur Professor!<wait 250> We found the pipe
that leads to Twilight Town...
<k>
<p>
...But it totally didn't work!
<wait 100>
It just pushes you right back
out!<wait 250> We can't get through.
<k> mac_3_008_nok Umm, Professor...<wait 250> We found
the pipe to Twilight Town...
<k>
<p>
But I don't think it works.
<wait 100>
The thing just rejects us.
<wait 250>
There's no way through it.
<k> mac_3_008_win Frankly!<wait 250> We found the pipe
you said would take us to
Twilight Town...
<k>
<p>
...But it doesn't work, darling.
<wait 100>
It just pushed us back out.
<wait 250>
Can't you do something?
<k> mac_3_008_yos Yo, Prof!<wait 250> We found your
pipe, and that thing's all
stopped up!
<k>
<p>
We tried and tried, but we
can't break through it!
<wait 250>
Got any drain cleaner?
<k> mac_3_009 What?<wait 250> You can't get through
the pipe, you say? <wait 100>How odd...
<k>
<p>
Hrmm...<wait 250> I'm afraid I haven't 
the foggiest idea of what you
should do.
<k> mac_3_010 Oh!<wait 250> Of course!
<k>
<p>
I've heard that a fellow from
Twilight Town lives here in
Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
If anybody knows how to get
through the pipe, it'll be him.
<k>
<p>
His name was, uh...<wait 250> Dang.
<wait 250>
What was it?
<k>
<p>
Ah, yes! <wait 100>The lover of dark
places! <wait 250><col c00000ff>DARKLY</col>!
<k>
<p>
I've seen him loitering right
here in this part of town in
the past.<wait 250> Look for Darkly!
<k> mac_3_011 Hi there! <wait 100>The name's Darkly.
<wait 250>
Do you guys need something?
<k> mac_3_012 Huh?<wait 250> You want to know how
to get through the pipe to
Twilight Town?
<k> mac_3_013 Couldn't be easier!<wait 250> You just
need to have something that
has your name written on it.
<k>
<p>
Don't you have anything<wait 250> that
has your name written on
it? <wait 250>C'mon, everyone does!
<k> mac_3_014 No?<wait 250> Really?<wait 250> OK. Hang on.
<wait 250>
I'll write it for you.
<wait 250>
What's your name?
<k> mac_3_015 Mario, huh?<wait 250> OK... <wait 100>I'll write it
here on the seat of your
overalls.<wait 250> M-A-R-I-O, right?
<k> mac_3_016 There!<wait 100> Perfect-a-mundo!
<wait 250>
While I'm at it, I'll write
your partner's name, too.
<k>
<p>
What's your name?
<k> mac_3_017_kur Goombella!
<k> mac_3_017_nok Um... <wait 250>K-Koops.
<k> mac_3_017_win Depends on who's asking!
<wait 100>

<k> mac_3_018_kur <wave>
Tee hee!<wait 250> That TICKLES!
<k> mac_3_018_nok <wave>

up on jabbing me, Pokey?
<k> mac_3_018_win <wave>

<k> mac_3_018_yos <wave>
Hey!<wait 250> Watch where you're
drawing, buddy!
<k> mac_3_019 I don't know what errand is
taking you to Twilight Town,
but I hope it goes well.
<k>
<p>
I'll be rooting for you!
<k> mac_4_000 What?<wait 250> Another terrifying
e-mail from Princess Peach?
<wait 250>
Are you sure it wasn't spam?
<k>
<p>
Hrmm...<wait 250> I've confirmed some
rather stunning things, too...
<wait 250>
To say the least...
<k>
<p>
Before we speak, though,
<wait 250>
take the Crystal Star to the
Thousand-Year Door, OK?
<k> mac_4_001_01 <dynamic 3>
<shake>

Whuh-Whuh-<wait 150>WHAAAAAAT?!?
<k> mac_4_001_02 <dynamic 3>
Th-That was written in
Princess Peach's e-mail?
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
The legendary treasure is
actually the spirit of an
ancient demon...
<k>
<p>
And those fiends want to use
the power of the Crystal
Stars to resurrect it?
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
How bone-chilling...<wait 250> Sadly, it
DOES seem to be consistent
with what I've uncovered...
<k> mac_4_001_03_kur Don't leave us in suspense!
<wait 250>
Give us the scoop, Professor!
<k> mac_4_001_03_nok Ummm... <wait 100>Well, will you tell us,
or what, Professor Frankly?
<k> mac_4_001_03_win Pray tell, what information
have you uncovered, Frankly?
<k> mac_4_001_03_yos Well, c'mon, give it up, Prof!
<wait 250>
What did you find out!
<k> mac_4_001_03_viv What have you found out,
Professor?
<k> mac_4_001_03_chu Well, we're waiting, Professor.
<wait 100>
What did you find out?
<k> mac_4_001_04 Hrmm...<wait 250> This is rather long,
so you'd best listen well.
<k> mac_4_001_05 <dynamic 3>
Are all of you ready?
<wait 250>
And you there! <wait 250>In front of
the TV! <wait 250>You listen up, too!
<k> mac_4_001_06_kur TV?<wait 100> You don't have a TV!
<wait 250>
What in the world are you
talking about?
<k> mac_4_001_06_nok Ummm... <wait 100>Who are you talking
to, sir?
<k> mac_4_001_06_win I declare, you've gone batty.
<wait 250>
What TV? <wait 100>To whom are you
speaking, Frankly?
<k> mac_4_001_06_yos Did someone pile-drive your
head, or what? <wait 100>I don't see
any TV here, nutjob!
<k> mac_4_001_06_viv Maybe I'm missing something...
<wait 100>
Are you talking to no one?
<k> mac_4_001_06_chu You strange, strange man.
<wait 250>
What did THAT mean?
<k> mac_4_001_07 <dynamic 3>
OH, NEVER YOU MIND!
</dynamic><wait 250>
Don't worry about such trivial
details.<wait 100> Just listen!
<k> mac_4_001_08 The great cataclysm that I
read about in that book may
well refer to this demon...
<k>
<p>
It says that a monster
destroyed a large town that
once stood on this very area.
<k>
<p>
It ALSO says that the seven
Crystal Stars were actually
CREATED by this monster...
<k>
<p>
AND that this thing used the
power of the Crystal Stars
to try to control the world...
<k> mac_4_001_09 According to this book, the
demon was defeated in the
end by four heroes.
<k>
<p>
But only the beast's physical
form was destroyed...<wait 250> Its spirit
could not be eradicated.
<k>
<p>
So, the heroes used the
Crystal Stars, which they
had stolen from the demon...
<k>
<p>
And they cast the evil beast
into the depths of a vast
maze, and sealed the exit...
<k>
<p>
From this, I gather that the
Crystal Stars cannot
distinguish good from evil.
<k>
<p>
So, if they're all united,
they could either seal away
or resurrect the demon.
<k>
<p>
It seems that who wields the
Crystal Stars determines if
they're used for evil or good.
<k> mac_4_001_10_kur Then the question is whether
gathering the Crystal Stars
is a danger in and of itself...
<k>
<p>
I mean, if we found them all
and then got robbed, the
demon could be revived!
<k>
<p>
Don't you think maybe it'd be
better to break them apart
and scatter the pieces?
<k> mac_4_001_10_nok Ummm... <wait 100>Doesn't that mean
that maybe gathering the
Crystal Stars is dangerous?
<k>
<p>
Say we did find them all...
<wait 100>
What if someone stole them?
<wait 250>
They could revive that thing!
<k>
<p>
Ummm... <wait 100>Call me crazy, but
maybe we oughta just
shatter those things.
<k> mac_4_001_10_win Well, we must consider the
idea that gathering the
Crystal Stars is unwise.
<k>
<p>
What if we found them all
and then got waylaid? <wait 250>That
awful thing could live again!
<k>
<p>
Forgive me for saying so,
but shouldn't we consider
destroying them?
<k> mac_4_001_10_yos Hey, then isn't it possible
that we shouldn't gather
these Crystal Stars?
<k>
<p>
Even if we do find 'em all,
someone could just steal 'em
all and revive that monster!
<k>
<p>
Maybe we oughta just stomp
the heck out of 'em and
throw the pieces away!
<k> mac_4_001_10_viv I guess we ought to consider
not collecting the Crystal
Stars, then...
<k>
<p>
It would be awful if we found
them all, only to have them
stolen for evil purposes.
<k>
<p>
Does anyone think it might
just be better to destroy
them once and for all? 
<k> mac_4_001_10_chu Well, the way I see it, it
may be entirely the wrong
idea to collect these things.
<k>
<p>
Why, someone could just steal
all the Crystal Stars from us
and resurrect that demon!
<k>
<p>
I feel as though the best
course of action might be to
destroy them utterly.
<k> mac_4_001_11 That was my first thought,
too, but further research
suggests we can't do that.
<k>
<p>
There's a slight possibility
that the Thousand-Year Door
<wait 150>
is weakening.
<k>
<p>
It seems the Crystal Stars
hold the power to seal the
beast for a thousand years.
<k>
<p>
So, once a thousand years
pass, the power to keep the
door sealed shut will fail.
<k>
<p>
And unfortunately, this year
may be the thousandth year.
<wait 250>
Bad luck, huh?
<k>
<p>
The fact that those goons
want the stars now may be
coincidence...<wait 250>but maybe not.
<k>
<p>
In other words, we must be
ready for the demon's return,
even if the X-Nauts fail.
<k> mac_4_001_12_kur In that case, we gotta go
collect the rest of the
Crystal Stars immediately!
<k>
<p>
No time to lose! <wait 100>Where
can we find the next one?
<k> mac_4_001_12_nok Well... <wait 100>Sheesh, we better go
get the rest of those
Crystal Stars, then!
<k>
<p>
Where can we find the next
one, Professor Frankly?
<k> mac_4_001_12_win Well, what are we dallying
for? <wait 100>We must find the rest
of the Crystal Stars!
<k>
<p>
Where to next, Frankly?
<k> mac_4_001_12_yos Whoa! <wait 100>Let's roll, then!
<wait 100>
We gotta get the rest of
those Crystal Stars!
<k>
<p>
Where's the next one at?
<k> mac_4_001_12_viv Oh.<wait 250> I guess we'd better find
the rest of the Crystal Stars
then, huh?
<k>
<p>
Where do we start?
<k> mac_4_001_12_chu Oh, my!<wait 100> I suppose we'd
better shake our tails and
find the other Crystal Stars!
<k>
<p>
Tell me, Professor, where is
the next one located?
<k> mac_4_002 Hrmm...<wait 250> According to the map,
it appears to be somewhere
on Keelhaul Key.
<k> mac_4_002_kur Keelhaul Key?
<k> mac_4_002_nok Keelhaul Key?
<k> mac_4_002_win Keelhaul Key?
<k> mac_4_002_yos Keelhaul Key?
<k> mac_4_002_viv Keelhaul Key?
<k> mac_4_002_chu Keelhaul Key?
<k> mac_4_003 I'm none too familiar with
the place, but I've heard
countless unsavory rumors.
<k>
<p>
You know, the usual stuff...
<wait 250>
Vengeful spirits full of hatred,
evil curses, things like that...
<k>
<p>
<wait 100>
I'm sure the sea salts down
by the harbor know more.
<wait 250>
You should head there first.
<k> mac_4_049 What do you blokes want?
<k> mac_4_049_01 I have no interest in passing
the time with you, so sorry.
<wait 250>
Now, away with you!
<k> mac_4_050 You seek Admiral Bobbery?
<k>
<p>
...Never heard of the gent.
<wait 250>
Take your search elsewhere.
<k> mac_4_051 Admiral Bobbery?
<k>
<p>
I haven't the faintest idea
what you're talking about.
<wait 250>
Now, if you please...
<k> mac_4_052_kur Don't play dumb with us!
<wait 250>
We were already told that
YOU are Admiral Bobbery!
<k> mac_4_052_nok Ummm... <wait 100>Listen, Mr. Bobbery...
<wait 250>
We already heard that you're
the Bobbery we're looking for.
<k> mac_4_052_win Oh, drop this SHAM, sir!
<wait 250>
We're already quite aware
that you're Bobbery!
<k> mac_4_052_yos Drop the act, Super 'Stache!
<wait 250>
We already found out that
you're Admiral Bobbery!
<k> mac_4_052_viv Please, don't insult us...
<wait 250>
We already know you're the
admiral, so just admit it!
<k> mac_4_052_chu Don't be so coy, Admiral!
<wait 250>
We've already found out
your identity!
<k> mac_4_053 Harumph! <wait 100>What poppycock...
<wait 250>
Tell me, what would you want
with me if I were this chap?
<k> mac_4_054 You say your ship needs a
navigator, and you want me
to do the job, mmm?
<k>
<p>
...So sorry, but you'll have to
look elsewhere.<wait 250> I shall set sail
upon the sea...<wait 100>nevermore!
<k> mac_4_055_kur But...<wait 250> Look, we're begging you
here!<wait 100> You totally have to!
<k>
<p>
You're the only one who can
guide our ship to Keelhaul
Key! <wait 100>This is serious stuff!
<k> mac_4_055_nok But...<wait 100> But...<wait 100> But...<wait 100> But...
<wait 250>
Please, Admiral, sir!
<wait 250>
We NEED you!
<k>
<p>
Nobody else can get us to
Keelhaul Key!
<k> mac_4_055_win But...<wait 250> Show some compassion,
dear man. <wait 100>Don't make us beg!
<wait 100>
We simply must have you!
<k>
<p>
You are our sole hope for
reaching Keelhaul Key!
<k> mac_4_055_yos But... <wait 100>That's just not cool!
<wait 250>
You wanna see me beg or
something?<wait 100> Is that it?
<k>
<p>
You HAVE to come along!
<wait 250>
Only you can get us safely
to Keelhaul Key!
<k> mac_4_055_viv But...<wait 250> Maybe you don't
understand how important
this is.<wait 250> We NEED you.
<k>
<p>
Without you, we'll never get
to Keelhaul Key!
<k> mac_4_055_chu But...<wait 250> Don't be like that!
<wait 100>
We truly need your help,
can't you see that?
<k>
<p>
Without you, we'll surely meet
our ends on the way to
Keelhaul Key!
<k> mac_4_056 Awfully sorry, dear boy, but
when I say "no," what I mean
is...<wait 250>NO!
<k> mac_4_056_01 Now, away with you!
<k> mac_4_057 I shall set sail upon the sea
nevermore.<wait 250> Away with you!
<k> mac_4_058_kur Darn!<wait 100> What do we do, Mario?
<wait 250>
That guy doesn't seem too
stoked to come with us.
<k> mac_4_058_nok Um... <wait 100>What's next, Mario?
<wait 250>
I don't think we're gonna
convince that guy to join us.
<k> mac_4_058_win I'm at a loss, Mario...
<wait 250>
This gentleman is stubborn
as an ornery old mule!
<k> mac_4_058_yos What's the next move, chief?
<wait 250>
This salty dude is going
nowhere fast.
<k> mac_4_058_viv What do you think, Mario?
<wait 250>
Nothing we say seems to be
enough to convince this man...
<k> mac_4_058_chu Mmmm... <wait 100>Your thoughts, Mario?
<wait 250>
We don't seem to be getting
anywhere with this man.
<k> mac_4_059_kur Know what I wonder, though?
<wait 250>
Why's he all weirded out
about the sea, anyway?
<k>
<p>
We oughta find someone who
knows this guy and find out
what his malfunction is.
<k> mac_4_059_nok He seems so bummed out...
<wait 250>
Why is he so hung up on not
sailing again, I wonder?
<k>
<p>
Maybe we should ask around
and see if anybody knows
the admiral's story.
<k> mac_4_059_win But... <wait 100>I can't help but wonder...
<wait 250>
What is it that turned this
poor man against the sea?
<k>
<p>
Perhaps it would behoove us
to search out someone who
knows him and ask about it.
<k> mac_4_059_yos I can't figure this guy out!
<wait 250>
What's his beef with the
ocean, anyway?
<k>
<p>
Know what we oughta do?<wait 250> Go
find someone who knows what
this dude's deal is!
<k> mac_4_059_viv But... <wait 100>Don't you find it odd?
<wait 250>
Why would a sailor have such
hatred for the sea?
<k>
<p>
We need answers... <wait 100>Maybe we
should ask around town
about this man's story...
<k> mac_4_059_chu I can't help but wonder...
<wait 250>
What could turn such a man
against the sea?
<k>
<p>
I think our only option is to
ask around and see if anyone
knows his tale.
<k> mac_4_060 Admiral Bobbery won't go to
sea? <wait 250>That's a setback.
<k>
<p>
Hrmm...<wait 250> I don't know the man
myself, so I don't know what
to tell you, unfortunately.
<k>
<p>
But I'd be willing to bet that
Podley knows a thing or two.
<wait 250>
He works at the inn's cafe.
<k> mac_4_077 What?!?<wait 250> Oh, by Blabberton's
beard! <wait 100>Not you again!
<k>
<p>
No matter how many times
you entreat me, my stance is
firm!<wait 250> Now away with you!
<k> mac_4_078 Pardon?<wait 250> A letter, you say?
<wait 250>
F-For me???
<k> mac_4_079 What?!?<wait 100> Scarlette!!!
<wait 250>
This is Scarlette's
handwriting!!!
<k> mac_4_080 Scarlette, my love...
<k> mac_4_081 <diary>
My love: if you're reading
this letter, then I am no
longer by your side.
<k>
<p>
Because fate has stepped
between us, I have decided
to write you this letter.
<k>
<p>
If you're reading this,
I must have passed away
while you were out to sea...
<k>
<p>
I can only assume that you
will blame yourself for it,
my sweet Bobbery.
<k>
<p>
Although my life was short,
you gave me more than a 
lifetime's worth of joy.
<k>
<p>
Though you will mourn, I
beg that you remember that
time, like love, is a tide.
<k>
<p>
You are one with the sea, as
you were one with me. Do not
lose both your life's loves.
<k> mac_4_082 "Time, like love, is a tide.
<wait 100>
You are one with the sea...
<wait 100>
as you were one with me..."
<k>
<p>
A...<wait 250> A thousand pardons...
<wait 250>
But may I have a moment
<wait 100>
alone, if you please?
<k> mac_4_083 Yes, love...<wait 250> I WAS happy...
<wait 250>
My sweet, sweet Scarlette...
<wait 500>
I love you still.
<k> mac_4_084 Now then! <wait 250>You were looking
for a navigator, I believe?
<wait 250>
Bound for Keelhaul Key?
<k> mac_4_085 Harumph!<wait 250> If you think an old
sea bomb like me is what you
need, then let's shove off!
<k> mac_4_086_kur Admiral Bobbery!!!<wait 100> Awesome!
<k> mac_4_086_nok Admiral Bobbery!!! <wait 100>Cool!
<k> mac_4_086_win Admiral Bobbery!!! <wait 100>Marvelous!
<k> mac_4_086_yos Admiral Bobbery!!! <wait 100>Yesss!
<k> mac_4_086_viv Admiral Bobbery!!! <wait 100>Wonderful!
<k> mac_4_086_chu Admiral Bobbery!!! <wait 100>Excellent!
<k> mac_4_087 The ship's in the harbor, hm?
<wait 250>
I must inspect her before we
leave. <wait 100>I shall meet you there.
<k> mac_5_000 Oh! <wait 100>Would you look at that!
<wait 250>
Another Crystal Star, eh?
<k>
<p>
Yes, well, as usual, take that
down to the Thousand-Year
Door.<wait 250> Then we'll talk.
<k> mac_5_002 <dynamic 3>
Great news, my friends!
</dynamic><wait 250>
The next Crystal Star is in
<col c00000ff>Poshley Heights</col>!
<k> mac_5_002_kur Wait a sec'! <wait 100>You mean where
all the rich and famous live?
<wait 100>
Like movie stars and stuff?
<k> mac_5_002_nok Wait... <wait 100>Don't a lot of really
rich and famous people live
in Poshley Heights?
<k> mac_5_002_win Just a moment! <wait 100>Isn't that
area known for its rich and
famous denizens?
<k> mac_5_002_yos Oh, man! <wait 100>Aren't there oodles
of rich and famous people
living in that place?
<k> mac_5_002_viv Hang on... <wait 100>Haven't I heard
that lots of rich and famous
people call that place home?
<k> mac_5_002_bom Wait a tick! <wait 100>I've heard tell
that only the rich and
famous call that place home...
<k> mac_5_002_chu Hey... <wait 100>Isn't that place simply
BURSTING with the rich and
famous? <wait 250>Excellent.
<k> mac_5_003 Yes, yes, and I'm fairly sure
there's also a shrine to the
stars called <col c00000ff>Poshley Sanctum</col>.
<k>
<p>
No fearsome monsters or
dangerous dungeons, either!
<wait 250>
It's just a tourist attraction!
<k> mac_5_004_kur So, uh, a little help, here?
<wait 250>
To get to Poshley Heights,
we should...
<k> mac_5_004_nok Sounds great!<wait 250> And to get to
this place, we should...
<k> mac_5_004_win Sounds absolutely fabulous!
<wait 250>
How do we get to this
wonderful town?
<k> mac_5_004_yos Get to the point, Prof!
<wait 250>
How do we get to this
Snobville, anyway?
<k> mac_5_004_viv Poshley Heights, huh? <wait 100>OK.
<wait 100>
How do we get there?
<k> mac_5_004_bom Harumph!<wait 250> Sounds positively
scintillating, dear boy.
<wait 250>
Point us there!
<k> mac_5_004_chu Well? <wait 100>Don't tease us,
Professor. <wait 250>How do we get
there from here?
<k> mac_5_005 <dynamic 3>
That's the best part! </dynamic><wait 250>You
ride the most famous train
of all! <wait 250><col c00000ff>The Excess Express</col>!
<k>
<p>
Yes!<wait 100> After a luxurious steam
engine excursion, the next
Crystal Star will be yours!
<k>
<p>
Getting those Crystal Stars
has been backbreaking work,
but this time will be a cinch!
<k> mac_5_006_kur But I thought you had to be,
like, rich or famous to get
an Excess Express ticket...
<k> mac_5_006_nok Um...<wait 100> But I thought only rich
or famous people can get
tickets on that train...
<k> mac_5_006_win Not to be a wet blanket, but
don't you have to be rich
or famous to ride that line?
<k> mac_5_006_yos Hey, I heard you had to be
all rich or famous to get a
ticket for that train!
<k> mac_5_006_viv Will they let us on board?
<wait 250>
I heard you have to be rich
or famous to get a seat.
<k> mac_5_006_bom Pardon me for saying so,
but mustn't you have wealth
or fame to ride that train?
<k> mac_5_006_chu You know, I had heard that
one must be rich or famous
to ride the Excess Express...
<k> mac_5_007 Hrmm...<wait 250> That may be true.
<wait 250>
Perhaps you should ask Don
Pianta for help with this, too.
<k> mac_5_008_kur Oh, no! <wait 250>No no no no no NO!
<wait 250>
Not that psychopath again!
<k>
<p>
...Oh, well. <wait 250>I guess we don't
have much choice, huh?
<wait 250>
C'mon, Mario. <wait 100>Let's go.
<k> mac_5_008_nok Oh, man! <wait 100>You gotta be joking
with me!<wait 250> That guy's scary!
<k>
<p>
...Great. <wait 250>Well, it's not like we
have much choice here.
<wait 250>
Let's go, Mario... <wait 250>Ugh...
<k> mac_5_008_win Good gracious, no! <wait 250>I'm afraid
I really must protest this!
<wait 250>
That man is TOO dangerous!
<k>
<p>
...Well, I suppose one must do
what one must do, correct?
<wait 250>
Let's get this over with.
<k> mac_5_008_yos Are you crazy?!?<wait 250> I heard
stories about that guy,
<wait 250>
and he sounds like a loon!
<k>
<p>
Man... <wait 250>Well, whatever, I guess.
<wait 250>
If we gotta, we gotta, right?
<wait 250>
Let's do this, Gonzales.
<k> mac_5_008_viv Are you kidding?<wait 250> Everyone
says he's an awful man!
<wait 250>
Doesn't he extort people?
<k>
<p>
...Well, I guess we don't have
much choice, now do we?
<wait 250>
Let's do this quickly.
<k> mac_5_008_bom Ah...no.<wait 250> Terribly sorry.<wait 250> Mm-mm.
<wait 250>
Impossible.<wait 250> Can't do it. 
<wait 250>
The man's reprehensible!
<k>
<p>
...Well, drat.<wait 250> I suppose there's
nothing for it, eh, old boy?
<wait 250>
If we must, we must. <wait 100>Let's go.
<k> mac_5_008_chu Oh, I do NOT think that's a
good idea! <wait 250>Do you know him?
<wait 250>
He is NOT one to mess with!
<k>
<p>
...Ah, well. <wait 250>If we have to, then
I'm in, but it could get ugly.
<wait 250>
Come on, Mario.<wait 100> Let's go.
<k> mac_5_009 Excellent. <wait 100>Then we're set!
<wait 250>
We may not have much time
left, so you must hurry.
<k>
<p>
I'll gather all the information
I can.<wait 250> You guys just handle
your end of things.
<k> mac_6_000 Oh!<wait 250> You got the next
Crystal Star! <wait 250>Well done!
<k>
<p>
Take that thing to the
Thousand-Year Door!
<k> mac_6_002_00 Hrmm...
<k> mac_6_002 If what this map indicates is
true, the location of the final
Crystal Star is...
<k> mac_6_003 <wait 100>
The moon.
<k> mac_6_004_kur The moon?!?
<k>
<p>
Princess Peach is there, too!
<wait 250>
This just seems wrong on,
like, SO many levels.
<k> mac_6_004_nok The moon?!?
<k>
<p>
Hey!<wait 100> Princess Peach is there!
<wait 250>
Oh, boy... <wait 100>Something about
this doesn't sit well...
<k> mac_6_004_win The moon?!?
<k>
<p>
Why, our Princess Peach is
there as well!<wait 250> I daresay
this doesn't bode well...
<k> mac_6_004_yos The moon?!?
<k>
<p>
That's where Princess Peach
is stuck! <wait 100>Yeah!<wait 100> Remember?
<wait 250>
...Seems suspicious, huh?
<k> mac_6_004_viv The moon?!?
<k>
<p>
Isn't Princess Peach also on
the moon?
<k> mac_6_004_bom The moon?!?
<k>
<p>
Great gobbledy! <wait 100>Princess
Peach is there as well!
<wait 250>
...This seems a bit...<wait 100>off.
<k> mac_6_004_chu The moon?!?
<k>
<p>
Isn't the princess trapped
there, too?<wait 250> Something about
this doesn't seem right...
<k> mac_6_005 Hrmmm...<wait 250> The problem here...
<wait 250>
is how does one get to the
moon?<wait 250> Quite a conundrum.
<k>
<p>
Give me a moment to look
into this.<wait 250> Excuse me, please.
<wait 250>
This shouldn't take long.
<k> mac_6_005_01 Ermmm... <wait 250>Looking into this may
take a little time, so come
back in a bit, all right?
<k> mac_6_006 I must concentrate on this,
so come back after about
three minutes, will you?
<k> mac_6_006_01 You're a little too soon.
<wait 250>
I'm still looking into this,
so come back later.
<k> mac_6_006_02 I've only just begun to
research.<wait 300> You'll have to wait
a bit longer.
<k> mac_6_006_03 Research takes time!<wait 250> Don't
you understand that?<wait 100> Hrmm?
<wait 300>
Wait over there or something.
<k> mac_6_006_04 No, this won't work either.
<wait 300>
What's left... <wait 500>Ah!<wait 100> Yes, of
course!<wait 100> That one book...
<k>
<p>
It looks like this will take
a while longer. <wait 250>Please come
back later, if you could.
<k> mac_6_006_05 Oh! <wait 100>Good timing, Mario!
<wait 300>
I've just hit on something,
I believe.
<k>
<p>
You should step out for a
breath of fresh air, and I'll
fill you in shortly.
<k> mac_6_006_06 I think I'll have an answer
in mere moments.<wait 300> You can
wait outside until then.
<k> mac_6_007 <dynamic 3>Ah!</dynamic> Excellent timing!
<k>
<p>
I finally have it, Mario!
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
I found a way that might just
get you to the moon!
<k>
<p>
You must go to Fahr Outpost.
<wait 250>
And you must use the cannon
there. <wait 250>And it will blast you.
<k> mac_6_008_kur Uh, hello? <wait 250>We're using a
CANNON to get to the moon?
<wait 250>
Isn't that, like, dangerous?
<k> mac_6_008_nok Umm... <wait 100>Excuse me?<wait 250> We're using
a cannon to reach the moon?
<wait 250>
Don't we want to live?
<k> mac_6_008_win Pardon me, sugar? <wait 250>We're to
use a CANNON to get to the
moon? <wait 250>Is that entirely safe?
<k> mac_6_008_yos Whoa! <wait 100>We're using a cannon
to blast ourselves to the
moon? <wait 250>YEAH!<wait 100> EXTREEEEME!
<k> mac_6_008_viv Uh... <wait 100>We're using a cannon to
get to the moon?<wait 250> Doesn't
that seem...<wait 100>unsafe?
<k> mac_6_008_bom So we're to use a cannon to
reach the moon, are we?
<wait 250>
Sounds capital!
<k> mac_6_008_chu We're using a CANNON to get
to the moon? <wait 250>Whatever you
say, darling...
<k> mac_6_009 I know how it sounds, really.
<wait 250>
To be honest, I'm not entirely
sure of all the details...
<k>
<p>
Accounts from Fahr Outpost
speak of a device that can
launch anything, anywhere.
<k>
<p>
Even to the moon!
<k> mac_6_010_kur Great. <wait 250>Sounds super, really.
<wait 250>
So where is this Fahr
Outpost, anyway?
<k> mac_6_010_nok Um...<wait 100>OK.<wait 250> Well, where is this
certain death...<wait 250>er...<wait 100>Fahr
Outpost, anyway?
<k> mac_6_010_win Well, let's not delay, hmm?
<wait 250>
Where is this Fahr Outpost?
<k> mac_6_010_yos This is gonna be so COOOOL!
<wait 250>
Just point the way! <wait 250>Where is
this Fahr Outpost?
<k> mac_6_010_viv Well, where is this Fahr
Outpost, then?
<k> mac_6_010_bom I must say, this Fahr Outpost
already sounds like it will
be a bother to reach...
<k> mac_6_010_chu Well, where is this Fahr
Outpost, Professor?
<k> mac_6_011 I believe there's a pipe to
Fahr Outpost somewhere
beneath Rogueport...
<k>
<p>
But I'm not sure of the exact
location.<wait 250> Yes, I believe it
was hidden for some reason.
<k>
<p>
If my information is correct,
you need something called an
<col c00000ff>Ultra Hammer</col> to get it.
<k> mac_6_012_kur An Ultra Hammer?
<k> mac_6_012_nok An Ultra Hammer?
<k> mac_6_012_win An Ultra Hammer?
<k> mac_6_012_yos An Ultra Hammer?
<k> mac_6_012_viv An Ultra Hammer?
<k> mac_6_012_bom An Ultra Hammer?
<k> mac_6_012_chu An Ultra Hammer?
<k> mac_6_012_01_kur An Ultra Hammer?!?
<k>
<p>
Well, it's party time, then!
<wait 250>
We already got one of those!
<k> mac_6_012_01_nok An Ultra Hammer?!?
<k>
<p>
Um... <wait 100>Didn't we already get
one of those!
<k> mac_6_012_01_win An Ultra Hammer?!?
<k>
<p>
Why, we already got one of
those! <wait 250>How marvelous!
<k> mac_6_012_01_yos An Ultra Hammer?!?
<k>
<p>
Hey! <wait 250>Right ON! <wait 100>We already
got one of those!
<k> mac_6_012_01_viv An Ultra Hammer?!?
<k>
<p>
Didn't we get one of those
already, Mario?
<k> mac_6_012_01_bom An Ultra Hammer?!?
<k>
<p>
Dear man, we've already
procured one of those!
<k> mac_6_012_01_chu An Ultra Hammer?!?
<k>
<p>
But, sweetie, we've already
got one of those!
<k> mac_6_013 Yes, apparently the Ultra
Hammer made for opening the
way is hidden here in town.
<k>
<p>
You'll have to figure out how
you're going to find it,
though, because I don't know.
<k>
<p>
Hmph! <wait 100>Good luck with that.
<wait 250>
Once you find it, the path to
Fahr Outpost will open.
<k> mac_6_013_01 <dynamic 3>
Ah! <wait 100>Well!<wait 100> I see!
</dynamic><wait 250>
That certainly changes the
subject, now, doesn't it?!?
<k>
<p>
Well, use that Ultra Hammer
to find the pipe to Fahr
Outpost, then. <wait 250>Get to it!
<k> mac_6_014_kur You got it, Professor!
<wait 250>
Fahr Outpost, here we come!
<k> mac_6_014_nok Yes, sir, Professor Frankly!
<wait 250>
We're off to Fahr Outpost!
<k> mac_6_014_win We are on our way, Frankly!
<wait 250>
To Fahr Outpost we go!
<k> mac_6_014_yos Yeah! <wait 100>You got it, Prof!
<wait 250>
Fahr Outpost! <wait 100>Chaaaarge!
<k> mac_6_014_viv If you say so, Professor!
<wait 250>
Let's find Fahr Outpost!
<k> mac_6_014_bom Hmm...<wait 250> Yes...<wait 250> I see! <wait 100>Quite so!
<wait 250>
Destination: Fahr Outpost!
<k> mac_6_014_chu No problem at all, sweetie!
<wait 250>
Fahr Outpost, it is!
<k> mac_6_015 Oh, yes...<wait 250> One more thing
you should be aware of...
<k>
<p>
The Bob-ombs who live there
are...<wait 100>sort of a surly bunch.
<k>
<p>
They may not let you use
their cannon.<wait 250> You may have
to negotiate with them.
<k>
<p>
In any case, that's your
problem!<wait 250> Good luck!
<wait 250>
Get that last Crystal Star!
<k> gor_02_000 What do you want, chump?
<wait 250>
If you ain't got business here,
then beat it!
<k> gor_02_001 This is where I live, chump.
<wait 250>
Unless you gotta see me for
somethin', you need to leave.
<k> gor_02_001_01 This is where I live, chump.
<wait 250>
Unless you gotta see me for
somethin', you need to leave.
<k> gor_02_002 Hey, you! <wait 250>Yeah, Chumpie!
<wait 250>
You meet that scum of the
earth, Don Pianta?
<k>
<p>
Looks like you got outta
there alive. <wait 250>That's a first!
<k> gor_02_003 Hey, you! <wait 250>Yeah, Mr. Chump!
<wait 250>
You met Don Pianta about
going to Glitzville, huh?
<k>
<p>
Back when I still had pull
in this town, I used to go
to Glitzville all the time.
<k> gor_02_003_01 Hey, you! <wait 250>Yeah, Mr. Chump!
<wait 250>
You met Don Pianta about
going to Glitzville, huh?
<k>
<p>
Back when I still had pull
in this town, I used to go
to Glitzville all the time.
<k> gor_02_003_02 Hey, you! <wait 250>Yeah, ol' Chumpie!
<wait 250>
...You say you made it to
Twilight Town?
<k>
<p>
Hey, we all got problems to
deal with, you know?
<k> gor_02_003_03 Hey, you! <wait 250>Yeah, el Chump!
<wait 250>
So, I hear you went to the
infamous Keelhaul Key.
<k>
<p>
So?<wait 250> Any treasure there?
<wait 250>
I tell you, you'd never find
me goin' to a place like that...
<k>
<p>
I mean, if you get cursed,
that's the end of it, y'know?
<wait 250>
Life's too precious, chump!
<k> gor_02_003_04 Hey, you!<wait 250> Yeah, the chump!
<wait 250>
So, you went to Poshley
Heights, did ya?
<k>
<p>
The people there are so
filthy rich, they border
on creepy!
<k>
<p>
I sure wouldn't mind goin'
there one day, though...<wait 250>and
startin' some trouble!
<k> gor_02_003_05 Hey, you! <wait 250>Yeah, Chumpley!
<wait 250>
Eh?!? <wait 250>Whuzzat???
<k>
<p>
You went to the moon?!?
<k>
<p>
Listen, I like your stories
and all, but this is too much...
<wait 250>
Did you conk your melon?
<k> gor_02_003_06 Hey, you!<wait 250> That was amazin'!
I can't believe how you
cleared out that darkness!
<k>
<p>
You really are incredible!
<wait 250>
If I ever have a problem,
I'm goin' straight to you.
<k>
<p>
You saved the world, guy!
<wait 250>
You're welcome here anytime!
<wait 250>
My house is yours!
<k> gor_02_004 Whoa!<wait 100> Whoa!<wait 100> Hold up, now!
<wait 250>
You're an outsider!
<k>
<p>
Past this point is the turf of
Ishnail, head of the Robbos.
<wait 250>
It's 10 coins to pass through.
<k>
<p>
You try to pass without
paying, and I'm afraid I'll
have to whip you but good.
<o> gor_02_005 Whoa!<wait 100> Whoa!<wait 100> Hold up, now!
<wait 250>
If you want to pass through
here, you gotta pay 10 coins.
<o> gor_02_005_select <select 0 -1 0 80>
Fine, I'll pay.
I'm not paying.
I can take you! gor_02_006 <p>
One, two, three...<wait 250> Yup!
<wait 250>
That's 10 coins all right!
<k>
<p>
You can pass.
<k> gor_02_006_01 You can pass.
<k> gor_02_006_02 <p>
Whoa! <wait 250>Whoa!<wait 250> Hold up, now!
<wait 250>
You don't have enough cash!
<wait 250>
You dirty, lying cheapskate!
<k> gor_02_007 <p>
It's really simple.<wait 250> If you
don't pay, you don't pass.
<k> gor_02_008 <p>
What?<wait 250> You gotta be kidding.
<wait 250>
You think you can fight your
way through here?
<k>
<p>
I'm gonna make you eat your
words, tough guy!<wait 250> Let's get
this party started!
<k> gor_02_008_00 Ha!<wait 250> Learn your lesson?
<wait 250>
Prediction: <wait 250>you'll NEVER try
to fight through here again.
<k>
<p>
I figure you just had a triple
helping of humble pie, so I'll
let this slide. <wait 250>Now take off!
<k> gor_02_008_01 <dynamic 3>
Huh!</dynamic><wait 300> That hurt?
<k>
<p>
You have no chance of
beating me, trust me...
<wait 250>
So, you'd better run.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, if you don't, seriously,
it'll be <col c00000ff>Game Over</col> for you!
<k>
<p>
You can choose to <col c00000ff>Run</col> from
your <col c00000ff>Tactics</col> menu.
<wait 300>
Sometimes, it's best to run.
<k> gor_02_009 <dynamic 3>
CRUD!</dynamic><wait 250> You dumb video-game
heroes ALWAYS pull this
stuff! <wait 250>It's RIDICULOUS!
<k>
<p>
You think violence solves
everything, don't you?<wait 250> Huh?
<wait 250>
DON'T YOU?!?
<k> gor_02_010 Hmph! <wait 250>Hauuuuuuck...ptooey!
<wait 250>
I spit on you!<wait 250> I HATE you!
<wait 250>
Get outta my sight!
<k> gor_02_010_01 Where do you get off, talking
to me like nothing happened?
<wait 250>
Like there was no "beating"?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, guys like you act real
cool when you win, but when
you lose, you're all "WAAAH!"
<k> gor_02_010_02 Where do you get off, talking
to me like nothing happened?
<wait 250>
Like there was no "whupping"?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, guys like you act real
cool when you win, but when
you lose, you're all "WAAAH!"
<k> gor_02_010_03 Since the boss has your back,
I'm not saying nothing.
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250>I still hate you with the
intensity of a thousand suns.
<wait 250>
Crud! <wait 250>I said something!
<k> gor_02_010_04 I'll tell you something: hitting
others hurts a lot more than
getting hit yourself!
<k>
<p>
Yeah, learn it early, or you'll
be scooping up your teeth
after a karmic beatdown!
<k> gor_02_010_05 Seriously, though...<wait 250> 10 coins
is nothing to beat somebody
over...<wait 250> You cheap meathead.
<k> gor_02_010_06 Hey, I came up with this
great new scheme to make
money!<wait 250> Check this out!
<k>
<p>
It's called a Sock Shop!
<wait 250>
You get to sock me ten times,
and it only costs 10 coins!
<k>
<p>
I figure uncontrollably violent
guys like you can't live
without socking people, right?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, the only thing is...
<wait 250>
That's such a pathetic way
to make a living.<wait 250> Crud...
<k> gor_02_010_07 Yeah, so, I heard you're
trying to save your girl...
<k>
<p>
And here I thought you were
just a randomly violent guy
full of pent-up anger.
<k>
<p>
It takes more than big
muscles to be a big man.
<wait 250>
You gotta have a big heart...
<k>
<p>
Crud...<wait 250> Where am I gonna
get one of...
<k> gor_02_010_08 You're amazing!<wait 250> I think I
might even brag about the
fact that you wrecked me!
<k>
<p>
...No, wait a second.
<k>
<p>
I can't brag about getting
beaten over 10 measly coins...
<wait 250>
That's pathetic!<wait 400> Crud!!!
<k> gor_02_011 Hey.<wait 250> We don't have much
here, but make yourself at
home, if you want.
<k> gor_02_011_01 Hey.<wait 250> We don't have much
here, but make yourself at
home, if you want.
<k> gor_02_011_02 Hey.<wait 250> We don't have much
here, but make yourself at
home, if you want.
<k> gor_02_011_03 Hey.<wait 250> We don't have much
here, but make yourself at
home, if you want.
<k> gor_02_011_04 Hey.<wait 250> We don't have much
here, but make yourself at
home, if you want.
<k> gor_02_011_05 Hey.<wait 250> We don't have much
here, but make yourself at
home, if you want.
<k> gor_02_011_06 Hey.<wait 250> We don't have much
here, but make yourself at
home, if you want.
<k> gor_02_011_07 Hey.<wait 250> We don't have much
here, but make yourself at
home, if you want.
<k> gor_02_012 <system>

It's locked from the inside.
<k> gor_02_013 If you want to get to Petal
Meadows, look for the pipe
beneath the town.
<k> gor_02_014 How's everything going?
<wait 250>
I know your quest is full of
danger, but you can do it.
<k> gor_02_015 There's a pipe that leads to
Boggly Woods beneath town.
<wait 250>
I suggest you look for that.
<k> gor_02_016 How's everything going?
<wait 250>
I know your quest is full of
danger, but you can do it.
<k> gor_02_017 Once you get a blimp ticket
from Don Pianta on the west
side, you can go to Glitzville.
<k> gor_02_018 You say you're a fighter at
the Glitz Pit?!?
<k>
<p>
Hrmm...<wait 300> Well, I suppose you'll
just have to work your way
up and win the championship.
<k> gor_02_019 There should be a pipe to
Twilight Town somewhere
beneath town.<wait 250> Look for it.
<k> gor_02_020 Got that?<wait 250> Look for Darkly,
who hails from Twilight Town.
<k>
<p>
He just may know a way to
get through that pipe.
<k>
<p>
He's probably around here
somewhere.<wait 250> Apparently he
likes dark places...
<k> gor_02_021 Well? <wait 250>How's it going?
<wait 250>
Your quest is dangerous,
but you'll find a way!
<k> gor_02_022 It'd be best to ask around
at the harbor about Keelhaul
Key...
<k> mac_4_048 Bobbery?
<k>
<p>
That old sea dog lives in
the eastside house right
next door.
<k>
<p>
They say he was a great and
important sailor long ago...
<k> gor_02_023 Well? <wait 250>How's it going?
<wait 250>
I'm in the middle of
researching that door more.
<k> gor_02_024 Head for Poshley Heights as
soon as you get a ticket
from Don Pianta...
<k>
<p>
I'm counting on you, Mario!
<wait 250>
Don't let the fiends beat
you there!
<k> gor_02_025 Well? <wait 250>How's it going?
<wait 250>
I'm in the middle of
researching that door more.
<k> gor_02_026 If you've gotten the Ultra
Hammer, use it to find the
pipe to Fahr Outpost.
<k>
<p>
The last Crystal Star is
so close!<wait 250> The end is near!
<wait 250>
We're counting on you!
<k> gor_02_026_01 It was written that the Ultra
Hammer is somewhere in town.
<wait 250>
Find it first, OK?
<k>
<p>
Then the way to Fahr
Outpost will be revealed.
<k> gor_02_027 The residents of Fahr
Outpost are extremely wary.
<k>
<p>
They feel they can only
trust Bob-ombs, and rarely
tell the truth to others.
<k> gor_02_028 You're almost done!
<wait 250>
And I'm still researching
the mysteries of the door!
<k> gor_02_029 You seem pretty cheery!
<wait 100>
And as always, I am happily
busy with my research.
<k> gor_02_029_01 By the by, do you know what
was in that treasure chest
we found in the palace?
<k>
<p>
It contained...
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>
A Dried Shroom!
</dynamic>
<k> gor_02_029_02 Oh, no!<wait 250> It's nothing to be
disappointed by!
<k>
<p>
Now we know for certain
that people indeed ate
mushrooms 1,000 years ago!
<k>
<p>
This is a groundbreaking
anthropological discovery!
<k> gor_02_029_03 I think I'll stay here and
continue my research a
while longer.
<k>
<p>
Yes, I'm fond of this place.
<wait 250>
Feel free to drop by anytime
you like.
<k> gor_02_aed_kur_01 Machi #1619 gor_02_aed_kur_02 Machi #1620 gor_02_aed_kur_03 Machi #1621 gor_02_aed_kur_04 Machi #1622 gor_02_030_00 Hey, ya big old rube!
<wait 250>
It ain't smart, talking
to people you don't know.
<k>
<p>
You never know when a guy
might go nuts and attack!
<wait 250>
Be careful, live longer!
<k> gor_02_030_01 Hey, it's that guy again!
<wait 250>
Have you been powering up
your party members?
<k>
<p>
If you don't, they're gonna
have a rough time as you
keep adventuring.
<k>
<p>
If you haven't been powering
them up, you'd better go over
there to Merlon's place.
<k> gor_02_030_02 Hey, it's that guy again!
<wait 250>
Have you been powering up
your party members?
<k>
<p>
If you don't, they're gonna
have a rough time as you
keep adventuring.
<k>
<p>
If you haven't been powering
them up, you'd better go over
there to Merlon's place.
<k> gor_02_030_02_01 You wanna find Don Pianta?
<wait 250>
I don't know why you think
I'd know something like that...
<k>
<p>
But the Robbo boss, who
claims this part of town as
his turf, might know.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, Ishnail--he's the Robbo
boss--and Don Pianta are
rival criminal heads.
<k>
<p>
So, of course, talking to
Ishnail about Don Pianta can
be<wait 150> hazardous to your health.
<k> gor_02_030_03 Really?<wait 250> You went to the
city in the sky? <wait 250>Cool.
<k>
<p>
I bet that place is all glitzy
and full of action.<wait 250> Must be
a fun spot, definitely.
<k> gor_02_030_03_01 Darkly?<wait 250> Oh, yeah! <wait 250>I've heard
of that guy!
<k>
<p>
That dude's always moving
from shadow to shadow.
<k>
<p>
I bet you can find him
behind a building or
something, definitely.
<k> gor_02_030_03_02 So, you found Darkly, huh?
<wait 300>
That's good...<wait 300> Not that I know
what's good about it, exactly.
<k> gor_02_030_04 When I've got a question
about something, I tend to
ask that Frankly guy.
<k>
<p>
He's an important professor,
so he knows lots of junk.
<k>
<p>
If you ever need help with
anything, you should ask
that guy, definitely.
<k> gor_02_030_05 Hey, <wait 250>Don Pianta collapsed!
<wait 250>
Yeah, the boss of west
Rogueport...<wait 250>down and out!
<k>
<p>
Had you heard that already?
<wait 250>
He's been in bed ever since.
<wait 250>
I wonder how he's doing.
<k> gor_02_030_06 Hey, it's that guy again!
<wait 250>
Have you been powering up
your partners?
<k>
<p>
If you don't have enough
Shine Sprites to power them
up, ask Merluvlee.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, sometimes I go see her
to get help finding stuff I've
misplaced or whatever.
<k>
<p>
Well, that's my excuse,
anyway. Truth is, I just like
to go see her.
<k> gor_02_030_07 Hey, did you hear there's
an incredible treasure hidden
somewhere under this town?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, still, I'd be wary of
what people tell you about it.
<wait 250>
It could be ANYTHING.
<k> gor_02_030_08 Hey, it's that guy again!
<wait 250>
Have you heard?<wait 250> The end of
the world arrived!
<k>
<p>
But then some guy came and
put an end to the badness!
<wait 300>
He was one tough dude.
<k> gor_02_031_00 If you've come all the way
here, you must've seen some
serious, dangerous action.
<k>
<p>
That's good.<wait 250> Danger's good.
<wait 250>
Believe me, I know.
<k> gor_02_031_01 If you've come all the way
here, you must've seen some
serious, dangerous action.
<k>
<p>
That's good.<wait 250> Danger's good.
<wait 250>
Believe me, I know.
<k> gor_02_031_02 Who, me?<wait 250> My name's Pierre. 
<wait 250>
I'm what's technically called
a "completely awesome thief."
<k>
<p>
I used to work as a geologist
researching the rocks under
town, but it paid NOTHING.
<k>
<p>
That's when Ishnail, the boss
of the Robbos, picked me up.
<k>
<p>
I've since washed my hands
of geology and am now an
amazing thief.<wait 250> Ha ha ha HA!
<k> gor_02_031_03 Who, me?<wait 250> My name's Pierre.

<k> gor_02_031_04 Hey, it's The Mustache!
<wait 250>
You remember me, right?
<wait 250>
Pierre the Thief!
<k>
<p>
I've got to be straight, here.
<wait 250>
Ishnail told me to wash my
hands of thievery.
<k>
<p>
So... <wait 250>I can't be a geologist...
<wait 250>
I can't be a thief...
<k>
<p>
What should I do, you think?
<wait 250>
Do I have NO talents?
<wait 250>
Ha ha ha HA! <wait 250>That's funny!
<k> gor_02_031_05 Hey, it's The Mustache!

<k> gor_02_031_06 Hey!<wait 250> It's The Mustache!
<wait 250>
Remember me? <wait 250>It's Pierre,
the unemployed slacker!
<k>
<p>
So, I decided to quit thieving,
but I still really want to
hang out with Ishnail.
<k>
<p>
Hmm...<wait 250> But if I'm not going
to be a thief, I have to do
something else for him.
<k>
<p>
What should I do, huh?
<wait 250>
I wonder if I'm just dumb.
<wait 250>
Ha HA!<wait 250> Dumb's a funny word!
<k> gor_02_031_07 Hey!<wait 250> It's The Mustache!

<k>
<p>
Is it really true you
defeated the Shadow Queen?
<wait 250>
That's absolutely amazing!
<k>
<p>
You've inspired me to figure
out how I can help Ishnail
without being a thief.
<k> gor_02_032_00 That Trouble Center is the
only place on the east side
that other townsfolk come to.
<k>
<p>
If the place is open when
you're in the neighborhood,
you should drop in.
<k> gor_02_032_01 The east side has some of
the worst crime anywhere
here in Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
Man, everyone who lives
around here is real tough.
<wait 250>
And street-smart, too.
<k>
<p>
I mean, when you don't have
any money, you gotta be
tough just to get by...
<k> gor_02_032_02 So, I've been thinking...
<wait 250>
and I think I want to meet
the Robbo boss just once...
<k>
<p>
Thing is, I have no idea
where the thieves' hideout
is located. <wait 250>None.
<k>
<p>
Rumor has it there's a secret
passageway around here...<wait 250>but
where could someone fit?
<k> gor_02_032_03 You know, there are always
rags-to-riches stories about
people from rough 'hoods.
<k>
<p>
When you grow up poor, other
poor people can really
identify with you, I think.
<k>
<p>
Anyway, poor or rich, anyone
can grow up to be president!
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
...Or grow up to be a hobo.
<k> gor_02_032_04 Swindell is here all the
time...<wait 250>usually.<wait 250> But not now.
<wait 100>
Where is he today?
<k>
<p>
I was thinking I'd come talk
to him about a way to make
some quick dough...
<k>
<p>
If you see him, tell him that
I'm looking for him, OK?
<k> gor_02_032_05 Sure, I want money, but I
don't need a lot of it.
<k>
<p>
The way I see it, the more
money you have, the more
money you WANT to have.
<k>
<p>
If I have enough to help my
friends and enjoy my days, I'll
be fine.<dkey><wait 500></dkey> Secret of life, man!
<k> gor_02_032_06 Sure, I want money, but I
don't need a lot of it.
<k>
<p>
The way I see it, the more
money you have, the more
money you WANT to have.
<k>
<p>
If I have enough to help my
friends and enjoy my days, I'll
be fine.<dkey><wait 500></dkey> Secret of life, man!
<k> gor_02_032_07 You know, I suppose you'd
have to classify me as a
rogue.<wait 250> But I have standards.
<k>
<p>
I only steal from the rich.
<wait 250>
Who could steal from people
who also have cash problems?
<k> gor_02_032_08 When the sky went dark,
even I was down on my
knees wishing for help...
<k>
<p>
Then light came to the
sky again!<wait 250> Now, I'm not
saying that my wish did it...
<k>
<p>
I'm just glad we were saved...
<wait 250>
I'm gonna change my ways!
<wait 250>
No more stealing for me!
<k> gor_02_033_00 This is east Rogueport.
<wait 300>
This is the turf of Ishnail
and his crew of Robbos.
<k>
<p>
The east side's all run-down.
<wait 250>
You can't even tell if these
buildings are vacant or not.
<k>
<p>
If you're down here, you darn
well better have a compelling
reason to be here.
<k> gor_02_033_01 Hey!<wait 250> This area is the turf
of Ishnail and the Robbo
band of thieves.
<k>
<p>
I don't know what brings you
here, but if you think you're
gonna meet the boss...<wait 250>HA!
<k> gor_02_033_02 Hey!<wait 250> This area is the turf
of Ishnail and the Robbo
band of thieves.
<k>
<p>
The boss is usually hiding out
in a back alley that few
people can spot...
<k> gor_02_033_03 Hey!<wait 250> This area is the turf
of Ishnail and the Robbo
band of thieves.
<k>
<p>
I don't know what brings you
here, but if you think you're
gonna meet the boss...<wait 250>HA!
<k> gor_02_033_04 The other day I saw this guy
jumping from roof to roof.
<wait 300>
Man!<wait 100> He was so dashing!
<k>
<p>
But, you know, actually...
<wait 250>
He might've been a bandit...
<k>
<p>
Maybe that's why he was
sneaking into chimneys!
<k> gor_02_033_05 I tell you, Ishnail is miles
better than that Don Pianta
guy! <wait 250>By a long shot!
<k>
<p>
Now, don't get me wrong!
<wait 250>
I've never met either one.
<wait 250>
So I'm just talking here...
<k> gor_02_033_06 Hey! <wait 250>Is it true Don Pianta
no longer heads the Pianta
syndicate? <wait 250>Frankie does?
<k>
<p>
Not that I've ever met
Frankie, either...
<k> gor_02_033_07 Hey! <wait 250>Is it true Don Pianta
no longer heads the Pianta
syndicate? <wait 250>Frankie does?
<k>
<p>
Not that I've ever met
Frankie, either...
<k> gor_02_033_08 You know who's better than
Ishnail, Don Pianta, and
Frankie combined?
<k>
<p>
You, man! <wait 250>You're number one!
<k>
<p>
And I'm so psyched, 'cause
I've met the number one
coolest guy in the world!
<k> gor_02_033_00_2 Heh heh heh!<wait 250> I'm pullin'

<wait 250>
I like dim places. <wait 250>Yeah.
<k>
<p>
I think in my past life I was
mold or a potato bug or
something. <wait 250>Yeah. <wait 250>Neat.
<k>
<p>
You know, it's neat 'cause I
just love places that are
dark and moist.
<k> gor_02_034_03 Hey. <wait 250>My name is Darkly.
<wait 250>
I like dim places. <wait 250>Yeah.
<k>
<p>
Huh?<wait 250> You say this town has
an underground part to it
and I should go there?
<k>
<p>
Yeah.<wait 250> Dark and dank down
there, I bet. <wait 250>But I'd have to
walk out in the sun...<wait 250>so, no.
<k> gor_02_034_04 I don't know what you hope
to do in Twilight Town, but
good luck.
<k>

I'm pulling for you.
<k> gor_02_034_05 I don't know what you hope

<wait 250>
I like dim places. <wait 250>Yeah.
<k>
<p>
So, how was Twilight Town?
<wait 250>
Don't you love how dim and
weird it is there?
<k>
<p>
I haven't been back in ages.
<wait 250>
I should go back there soon
for a visit...
<k> gor_02_034_07 Hey. <wait 250>Yeah, it's me, Darkly.
<wait 250>
I like dim places. <wait 250>Yeah.
<k>
<p>
Did you know that the mayor
of Twilight Town is my
grandfather? <wait 250>Yeah, he is.
<k>
<p>
What?<wait 250> He turned into a pig?
<wait 250>
Ah hah hah hah!<wait 250> You tell
the most ridiculous lies!
<k> gor_02_034_08 Hey. <wait 250>Yeah, it's me, Darkly.
<wait 250>
I like dim places. <wait 250>Yeah.
<k>
<p>
Twilight Town is pretty nice,
but I like this place, too.
<k>
<p>
I mean, this place is more
than just dim and dank.
<wait 250>
The people are slimy, too!
<k> gor_02_034_09 Hey. <wait 250>Yeah, it's me, Darkly.
<wait 250>
I like dim places. <wait 250>Yeah.
<k>
<p>
It would be great if the whole
world would go as dark as
the middle of night...
<k>
 gor_02_034_10 Hey. <wait 250>Yeah, it's me, Darkly.
<wait 250>
I like dim places. <wait 250>Yeah.
<k>
<p>
Remember when the whole
world went as dark as night?
<k>
<p>
I had just been thinking it
would be great if the world
went dark, then it did!
<k>
<p>
But that dark was different.
<wait 250>
It wasn't a good dark, no.
<wait 250>
It was a scary dark...
<k>
<p>
I'm glad it went back to
the way it was.
<k>
<p>
And now, I think it's probably
better that the world not go
dark like that ever again.

<p>
<col 202060ff>
Ages ago, a city flourished
here in peace and splendor.
<k>
<p>
...But it was destroyed in a
single day by a demon from
the dark beyond.
<k>
<p>
Historians claim a great
calamity befell the city,
but nay...<wait 250>'twas a demon.
<k>
<p>
The city sank below ground,
and one-quarter of the old
city became the demon's den.
<k>
<p>
This demon put fear into the
hearts of all men and sent
out minions to take the land.
<k>
<p>
And its den, its palace, grew
rich with the treasures stolen
from all over the world.
<k></col>
<o> jperfect_code_0001 <!STG4_15,The Crystal Stars>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
In order to increase its
already formidable power...
<k>
<p>
The demon created Crystal
Stars to hold the essence
of the heavens.
<k>
<p>
One of these stars was
placed in each country to
exert the demon's influence.
<k>
<p>
One of the castles built to
contain these stars still
stands near Petal Meadows.
<k></col>
<o> jperfect_code_0002 <!STG6_54,Dragons and Dungeons>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
The demon built a dungeon
near its palace and filled
it with terrifying monsters...
<k>
<p>
All those who fell into
disfavor were thrown into
this dungeon to rot...
<k>
<p>
Yea, and the demon also had
three dragon pets: <wait 250>Hooktail,
Gloomtail, and Bonetail.
<k>
<p>
These dragons flew across
the land, spreading fear
and sorrow over all.
<k>
<p>
Even now, the mere mention
of a dragon is enough to
give some the terrors...
<k></col>
<o> jperfect_code_0003 <!STG0_00,The Hero Who Arose>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
One day, there came a hero
who could vanquish the
fell demon.
<k>
<p>
The young Toad from Petal
Meadows was strong of arm,
but shy of voice...
<k>
<p>
All those around the boy
teased him endlessly about
the way he spoke.
<k>
<p>
But when the demon cast his
fearful gaze across the
lands and reached out...
<k>
<p>
The young Toad used his
strength and honor to
defend his people.
<k>
<p>
And he became a hero to all,
despite his odd voice.
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0004 <!STG3_20,The Wise Goomba>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
There was a wise Goomba
from Boggly Woods gifted in
knowledge of the world.
<k>
<p>
When beasts rose to take
the woods, this knowledge
helped the people fight them.
<k>
<p>
And this Goomba, who knew
the way that every monster
would attack...
<k>
<p>
She began to think of a way
to banish all monsters from
the land...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0005 <!STG3_30,The Stalwart Koopa>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
A Koopa who traveled the
world alone learned of the
darkness covering the land...
<k>
<p>
He went alone wherever evil
dwelt, and banished it with
shell and sheer bravado.
<k>
<p>
The monsters grew to fear
this scar-riddled Koopa who
thwarted them at every turn.
<k>
<p>
But the brave Koopa was
finally taken in a trap set
for him by the monsters.
<k>
<p>
But then, a Boo who fought
with the monsters came and
used her magic to free him.
<k>
<p>
The brave Koopa's spirit
had melted the heart of the
cold Boo lass...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0006 <!STG3_32,The Four Heroes>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
The Boo used her powerful
magic to learn more about
the evil they faced...
<k>
<p>
"We cannot destroy this
darkness alone," she decided,
her face a grim mask.
<k>
<p>
"We need the Toad hero of
Petal Meadows and the wise
Goomba of Boggly Woods."
<k><p>
The Boo's magic drew the
four heroes together to send
the demon from the world.
<k>
<p>
And so, the four heroes
finally set out for the
Palace of Shadow...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0007 <!STG4_05,The Duel With the Demon>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
The power of the world-
devouring demon was greater
than any could imagine...
<k>
<p>
But the wise Goomba soon
realized that this was the
power of the Crystal Stars...
<k>
<p>
She thought of a way to
take the stars and use them
against the demon.
<k>
<p>
She told the other heroes
her plan and set it in motion,
banishing their fears.
<k>
<p>
The Boo's magic and the
Toad's strength created a
gap in the demon's defenses...
<k>
<p>
At that moment, the brave
Koopa seized the stars...
<k>
<p>
And succeeded in badly
damaging the demon...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0008 <!STG4_15,The Demon Sealed Within>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
But even the brave Koopa's
stroke was not enough to
end the demon's reign...
<k>
<p>
The wise Goomba thought of
another use for the Crystal
Stars in that dire hour...
<k>
<p>
She suggested sealing the
demon forever with the
Crystal Stars.<wait 250> All agreed.
<k>
<p>
The heroes matched their
strengths with the power
of the Crystal Stars...
<k>
<p>
And they successfully sealed
the demon's soul within the
deepest part of the palace.
<k>
<p>
Together, they made it so
that only all seven stars
could break the seal...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0009 <!STG5_43,The Demon's Curse>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
The four heroes thought
they had sealed away the
demon and all of its powers...
<k>
<p>
But the demon used a tiny
opening before the seal was
complete to curse them all.
<k>
<p>
While holding the Crystal
Stars, they'd feel nothing,
but when they let them go...
<k>
<p>
A black box would appear to
seal their souls within.
<k>
<p>
The four heroes traveled the
world, scattering the stars
so the seal would remain.
<k>
<p>
But the last four stars each
carried the curse, which
claimed each hero...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0010 <!STG5_43,The Great Tree and Punies>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
The hiding places of many of
the Crystal Stars have now
faded into legend.
<k>
<p>
But some say that the wise
Goomba hid one in the
Great Tree.
<k>
<p>
At that time, many monsters
wandered in the nearby
Boggly Woods.
<k>
<p>
The tiny Punies were always
tormented by their fierce
appetites, it was said.
<k>
<p>
Pitying them, the Goomba
hollowed out the Great Tree
for the Punies to live in.
<k>
<p>
The Punies were so grateful
that they swore to protect
the Crystal Star there...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0011 <!STG6_54,The Boo Heroine's Last Days>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
Once the Boo heroine hid her
star in a steeple, she was
trapped in the nearby town...
<k>
<p>
Some say the Crystal Star
lies in that steeple still...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0012 <!STG5_43,The Pirate King Cortez>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
The Koopa hero went to a
southern isle to hide his star
where none would find it.
<k>
<p>
But the Koopa was so tired
from his journey that the
pirate Cortez stole it easily.
<k>
<p>
In that very instant, the
brave Koopa was trapped in
an inescapable chest.
<k>
<p>
But Cortez did not realize
the power of the star and
lost it among his treasures...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0013 <!STG6_54,The Toad Hero's Final Days>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
The strong Toad held his
star and continued his
arduous journey.
<k>
<p>
But eventually the miles
took their toll upon him,
and he collapsed.
<k>
<p>
A traveling healer happened
by and saved his life...
<k>
<p>
But the Toad knew his fate
was to be trapped in the
box when the star was gone...
<k>
<p>
So he asked this healer to
hide the star in a secret
place known to no one...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0014 <!STG4_15,All Becomes Legend>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
After the demon was sealed
within the Palace of Shadow...
<k>
<p>
Many refused to come near
that place of terror.
<k>
<p>
But as the years passed,
entire generations forgot...
<k>
<p>
And the penniless and the
immoral began to congregate
in this once-barren place...
<k>
<p>
This place soon became a
populous harbor, the town
of Rogueport...
<k>
<p>
And some even began to say
that the underground city
held a legendary treasure.
<k>
<p>
But they were unaware that
the demon slept beneath
them still...
</col><k>
<o> jperfect_code_0015 <!STG7_20,The Magical Map>
<p>
<col 202060ff>
The heroes knew that the
seal might not last forever...
<k>
<p>
And they sought to make the
Crystal Stars available to
one who might need them...
<k>
<p>
So, before going to their
individual dooms, they made
a map to all the stars.
<k>
<p>
And to prevent an evil force
from misusing this map...
<k>
<p>
They placed it in a box that
could only be opened by the
pure of heart.

Those are some low prices.
<wait 250>
I can't believe they're
selling that low...
<k>
<p>
Hmm...<wait 250> Even if I try to
compete with them, I don't
think I can profit.

<p>
But it is certainly helpful
information.<wait 250> Here's your

Well, fine.<wait 250> Let's get it done.

So, don't tell anyone that
we're the ones running the

<k> irai_oku_01 If you want to take on a

the main entrance.
<k>
<p>
Look, a lot of, shall we say,

Not to belabor the point, but

It's considered dangerous
here, even for Rogueport!

<p>
This is Ishnail's turf.
<wait 250>
He's the leader of a band
of thieves called the Robbos.
<k>
<p>
Then again, you can also
find Merlon here. <wait 250>He can help
your partners level up.
<k>

Still, it's definitely too
rough a place for a girl
like me to walk alone... <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0>
<k> ƒpƒ[ƒAƒbƒv‰® <keyxon>
That's Merlon.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's this odd
old man who says really
bizarre things sometimes.
<k>
<p>
He helps power up your allies
here.<wait 300> For three Shine Sprites,
he raises a partner one rank.
<k> ƒNƒŠƒnƒJƒZ <keyxon>
That's Professor Frankly,
head of the archaeology
department at U Goom.
<k>
<p>
He's researching the
legendary treasure here.
<wait 300>
I totally respect him.
<k>
<p>
You know the famous
Professor Kolorado? <wait 250>He was a
student of Frankly's!
<k> î•ñ‰®Š®à♪ <keyxon>
That guy's name is Grifty.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's a laid-back rooftop
minstrel-type guy.
<k>
<p>
He tends to know all of the
stories that get passed
around Rogueport's streets.
<k>
<p>
For a couple coins, he'll tell
you one...<wait 300>and you never know,
it might help on our travels.
<k> “‘¯’c‚P <keyxon>
That's Gus. <wait 250>He's part of that
band of thieves who call
themselves the Robbos.
<k>
<p>
He looks like a total maniac,
but he's actually a nice guy.
<wait 300>
Don't judge books by covers!
<k> “‘¯’c‚Q <keyxon>
That's Garf, part of the
Robbo gang.<wait 300> I'm pretty sure
he's related to Gus.
<k>
<p>
He looks pretty gnarly, but
he's actually pretty cool.
<wait 300>
Don't judge folks on looks!
<k> “‘¯’c‚R <keyxon>
That's Goose. <wait 300>Turns out the
Trouble Center was being run
by him and Ishnail's boys.
<k>
<p>
He may look violent, but he's
actually an intellectual.
<wait 300>
People surprise you, huh?
<k> “‘¯’ce•ª <keyxon>
That's Ishnail, leader of the
thief band called the Robbos.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He REALLY hates Don Pianta.
<k>
<p>
I guess that's to be expected,
since they're bitter rivals
and everything.
<k>
<p>
He's got some issues about
money, but he's OK otherwise.
<wait 300>
Who knew?
<k> ƒTƒ“ƒ_[ƒX <keyxon>
That's a Bob-omb sailor.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
The workers at the docks
say he's some kind of legend.
<k>
<p>
I heard he was stubborn, but
who knew he'd give us this
much trouble?<wait 250> Seriously!
<k>
<p>
It'd be nice if Professor
Frankly could tell us
something about him...
<k> ƒNƒŠƒ{[‚S <keyxon>
That's Goomfrey the Goomba.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He looks kind of shady, I
guess, but he's cool.
<k>
<p>
People call him a "fixer."
<wait 250>
Y'know, a guy that can make
any problem...<wait 250>just go away.
<k> ƒ`ƒ…[‚³‚ñ‚R <keyxon>
That's Pierre.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He sure does
seem to have a lot of free
time, doesn't he?
<k>
<p>
Word is, he's been busting his
tail lately to catch the eye
of the crime boss, Ishnail.
<k> ƒƒeƒ“‚R <keyxon>
That's Arfur.<wait 300> He's always
hanging around here.
<k>
<p>
He looks totally suspicious,
but apparently he lives by
some super-stern moral code.
<k> ƒ{ƒƒh[‚P <keyxon>
That's Swindell, the bandit.
<wait 300>
At least, I HEAR he's a thief,
but I've never seen him steal.
<k>
<p>
He's always whispering to
Arfur about something.
<k> ƒ{ƒƒh[‚Q <keyxon>
That's Larson, the bandit.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
The word's out on his scam,
so he's laying low here.
<k>
<p>
Of course, he wouldn't have
to lay low ANYWHERE if he'd
just kept his nose clean...
<k>
<p>
You think maybe he just gets
a thrill from breaking the
law or what?
<k> ƒNƒ‰ƒKƒŠ‚³‚ñ <keyxon>
That's Darkly. He loooooooves
the dark.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He just stays here

Sounds kinda creepy to me,
but hey, whatever powers

<k>
<p>
Are you kidding?<wait 250> Ordinary
guys like me never get to
meet a guy like him.
<k>
<p>
Even if you were to meet him,
there's no telling what he
might do to you!
<k>
<p>
If you really, REALLY want to
see him, ask the Robbo boss
on the east side about him.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, I bet Ishnail will know
how to get in touch with
Don Pianta...

<k> gor_03_024 Grrr...<wait 250> My wife spends all day 
in the parlor,<wait 250> so I never
get ANYWHERE on my novel.
<k>
<p>
I need to go off to places I've
never seen to get inspired to
write. <wait 250>Or SOMETHING!
<k> gor_03_025 Grrr...<wait 250> My wife spends all day 
in the parlor,<wait 250> so I never

<k>
<p>
I wish I could have fun, too.
<wait 250>
I want to go to Glitzville
and see the matches!
<k> gor_03_026 Grrr...<wait 250> My kid just plays all

up normal and everything...

<p>
I can't work 'cause I worry
about him.<wait 250> I need a
dark, quiet place to write...
<k>
<p>
No...<wait 250> If it's too dark, I'll just
fall asleep, and then my
novel will never get written.
<k> gor_03_027 Grrr...<wait 250> My kid spends all day
shut up indoors. <wait 250>I hope he's
not warped or anything...
<k>
<p>
I sure would like to go to a
deserted island where I could
write without any worries...
<k> gor_03_028 Grrr...<wait 250> I can't write anything
good at all...<wait 250> I just stink.
<wait 250>
I stink at writing.
<k>
<p>
I bet if I were to ride on
the Excess Express, I could
come up with a good tale...
<k> gor_03_029 Grrr...<wait 250> I can't write anything
good at all...<wait 250> I'm just bad.
<wait 250>
I am BAD at writing.
<k>
<p>
Maybe I'll take the family
somewhere far away to blast
my creative side into gear...
<k> gor_03_030 Everyone was so happy once
I finally made some solid
travel plans. <wait 250>Imagine that!
<k>
<p>
It's good to take vacations.
<wait 250>
Yeah, real good... <wait 250>I even got
an idea for my novel!
<k>
<p>
It's gonna be "The Adventures
of This Guy Standing Right
Here...Mario"!<wait 250> Yeah!
<k>
<p>
If I ever finish it, I'll let you
know. <wait 250>I'm not promising any
royalties or anything, though.
<k> gor_03_031 The book I wrote about your 
quest was a huge success. <wait 250>It's
even been made into a play!
<k>
<p>
To thank you for the
inspiration, I dubbed it
"Paper Mario"!
<k> gor_03_032 My dad's writing a novel.
<k>

But it'll never sell.
<k>
<p>
It's terrible...
<k> gor_03_033 My mom just plays games all
day long.
<k>
<p>
She doesn't have a job.
<wait 250>
She never cleans.
<k>
<p>
It's terrible...
<k> gor_03_034 My brother just plays all day.
<k>
<p>
He never does his homework.
<k>
<p>
It's terrible...
<k> gor_03_035 I never play outside at all.
<k>
<p>
This town is too crowded and
scary and weird...
<k>
<p>
It's terrible...
<k> gor_03_036 It sure would be nice to eat
dinner as a family and take
a vacation sometime...
<k>
<p>
But we never hang out
together as a family...
<k>
<p>
It's terrible...
<k> gor_03_037 My family never talks.
<k>
<p>
We all do our own things.
<k>
<p>
I just wish...
<k> gor_03_038 Hey, Mom cooked spaghetti
yesterday!<wait 250> It was soooo
delicious!
<k>
<p>
And my brother asked if I
wanted to play soccer with
him!<wait 250> It was so fun!
<k>
<p>
And Dad said we were all
going to take a trip together.
<wait 250>
I'm so happy!
<k> gor_03_039 My family is so happy now.
<k>
<p>
So I'm happy, too!
<k> gor_03_040 I almost fell down that grate!
<wait 250>
MAN, that was close!

I know where that thing
leads to, too!<wait 250> All too well!

<k> gor_03_043 The reason I'm always hanging
out around here is because
it's so boring back at home.
<k>
<p>
My dad spends all day writing
bad novels that never sell,
Mom LIVES at the parlor...
<k>
<p>
...And my brother never
leaves the house at all.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, so you can see why
I'm not exactly in a rush
to go back there.

<k> gor_03_045 My kid brother never sets
foot outside.<wait 250> Maybe I should
offer to let him play with me.
<k>
<p>
Yeah...<wait 250> I think I'll ask
him if he wants to play
soccer with me.
<k> gor_03_046 I asked my brother if he
wanted to play soccer with
me, and he was so happy.
<k>
<p>
If I'd known it would make
him so happy, I would have
asked him sooner, y'know?
<k>
<p>
But since I didn't, I'll just
have to play with him that
much more from now on!
<k> gor_03_047 I played soccer with my
kid brother yesterday.
<wait 250>
Boy, it was so fun!
<k>
<p>
He's actually pretty darned
athletic! We're getting along
really well now.
<k>
<p>
We're gonna play together
again tomorrow. <wait 250>I can't wait!

<p>
<wait 250>
But...<wait 250>I guess I SHOULD pay
a little more attention to
them, maybe...
<k> gor_03_054 Guess what!<wait 250> I made a big
spaghetti dinner for my
kids yesterday!
<k>
<p>
<wave>
They were so very happy!
<wait 250>
It was great! I felt very...
<wait 250>

<p>
If I get to see smiles like
those, I'll make dinner for

<k>
<p>
<wait 100>
...But I still can't help coming
here to check the high
scores pretty often.
<k> gor_03_055 <wave>
I went on a trip with the
whole family the other day.
<wait 250>
It was fantastic!
<k>
<p>
It was really fun<wait 250> spending
time together as a family! ﾘ

<k>
<p>
I still can't stop checking

But I'm definitely going to
spend more time with my
family from now on! ﾘ
<k> gor_03_056 Yet another day dwindles

<p>
Oh, well...<wait 250> I AM rich, after all!
<k> gor_03_057 Yet another day dwindles
away while I loaf in bed,
doing nothing...
<k>
<p>
Oh, guess what?<wait 250> I won first
prize in the Happy Lucky
Lottery today, but...
<k>
<p>
I didn't even go outside.
<wait 250>
I should have gone to collect
my prize...
<k>
<p>
Oh, well...<wait 250> I'm already rich
anyway, so whatever!
<k> gor_03_058 Yet another day dwindles
away while I loaf in bed,
doing nothing...
<k>
<p>
Oh, well...<wait 250> The Great Gonzales
won, so I'm uber-rich all
over again!
<k> gor_03_059 Yet another day dwindles
away while I loaf in bed,
doing nothing...
<k>
<p>
Oh, well...<wait 250> I sold so much stuff
in internet auctions that I'm
richer than ever!
<k> gor_03_060 Yet another day dwindles
away while I loaf in bed,
doing nothing...
<k>
<p>
Oh, well...<wait 250> I sold the deserted
island I owned for boatloads
of more cash, so whatever!
<k> gor_03_061 Yet another day dwindles
away while I loaf in bed,
doing nothing...
<k>
<p>
Oh, well...<wait 100> But<wait 250> all this loafing
is starting to depress me.
<k>
<p>
I may have tons of money,
but I have no idea how to
use it!
<k>
<p>
But you probably can't relate
to my problems.<wait 250> You don't
look rich at all.
<k> gor_03_062 Yesterday I got out of bed
for the first time in a
while and went for a walk.
<k>
<p>
I wandered under the sky...
<wait 250>
I had completely forgotten
just how blue it can be.
<k>
<p>
No matter how much money
I have, I'll never be able
to buy that blue, blue sky.
<k>
<p>
But it's given me insight into
how I can use the endless
sums of money I have...
<k> gor_03_063 There was this guy who said
he wanted to turn the novel
"Paper Mario" into a movie.
<k>
<p>
He said he wanted me to
help him do it. <wait 250>Sort of as an
executive producer.
<k>
<p>
I read that novel, too, and
it was pretty disturbing.
<wait 250>
Still, I was moved.
<k>
<p>
I thought, THIS would be an
effective use of my vast sums
of money!
<k>
<p>
Perhaps the time for me to
get out of bed and become
productive has finally come.
<k> gor_03_064 Ahhh...<wait 250> How refreshing...
<k>
<p>
This is my favorite place.

Life feels so simple when I'm

<k> gor_03_070 Ahhh...<wait 250> How refreshing...

I don't know why, but I never
tire of gazing at the
fountain.<wait 250> Maybe I'm just tired.

I don't know why, but I never

drift by.<wait 250> Maybe I'm just tired.
<k> gor_03_072 Wow!<wait 250> This town may be full
of rogues and punks, but this

my shop? <wait 250>Uh-huh, I knew it!
<k>
<p>
I always like to explain our
shop-point system to new
customers, so listen, OK?
<k>
 gor_shop2_31 Customers get one shop
point for each purchase they
make, right?
<k>
<p>
Save up enough shop points
and you can get prizes,
<wait 250>
including some rare items.
<k>
<p>
You'll find a list of prizes
posted in any shop, so be
sure to check it out, OK?
<k>
<p>
It's a pretty simple promotion,
don't you think, cutie?
<wait 250>
Need me to explain it again?
<o> gor_shop2_32 <p>
OK, in that case...
<k>
 gor_shop2_33 <p>
Well, take your time, and
enjoy your shopping, cutie!
<k> gor_shop2_34 You saved up 300 shop
points!<wait 250> That's the most ever!
<wait 250>
The maximum!<wait 250> Wow!
<k>
<p>
So, I guess from here...
<k>
<p>
Wow! <wait 250>You won't believe this!
<wait 250>
This is awesome, cutie-pie!
<k>
<p>
You get to start collecting
points ALL OVER AGAIN!

Oh, and you get the amazing

<k>
<p>
Well, I'm in charge of the

I know all there is to know
about this place, so if you

<wait 250>
Ugh!<wait 250> Fine!<wait 250> Whatever...

I'm eighteen.<wait 250> My favorite

<wait 250>

<p>
Ugh!<wait 250> Fine!<wait 250> Whatever...
<wait 250>
Um...
<k>
<p>
My sister Peeka works in the

along REALLY well!
<k>
<p>
We go shopping together
whenever we get a day off.
<wait 250>
So much FUN, shopping!
<k>
<p>
Peeka likes jewelry and
bags and things, but those
don't interest me at all.
<k>
<p>
I guess maybe I could use
a little more flair in my
outfits, though...
<k>
<p>
OK! <wait 250>That's enough.
<k>
<p>
Maybe I'll tell you more if you
get another high score.

<k>
<p>
Ugh!<wait 250> Fine!<wait 250> Whatever...

Um...

I really love sweets, so I
ask Zess T. to bake stuff for
me all the time.
<k>
<p>
Ooh, and I love nothing
better than a nice, sweet
cake, but...
<k>
<p>
Lately I've been feeling
a little chunky, though...
<wait 250>
So I'm on a diet.
<k>
<p>
But hey! That's a secret!
<wait 250>
Seriously! Don't tell Peeka!
<k>
<p>
But that's all for now.

to dinner.
<k>

But I said no...<wait 250> I mean, I don't

<k>
<p>
Still, I wonder if he really
likes me...

I just don't get it, though.

<wait 250>
I mean, really...

My dream is to have my own

<k>
<p>
I just wanna be surrounded
by cakes and cute stuff all
the time...
<k>
<p>
And then I'd get all the
people I like to hang out
here...<wait 250> It'd be sooo great!
<k>
<p>
So, I've gotta work hard now
to make my dream come true.
<k>
<p>
But I kind of like being a
parlor kitty, too, tee-hee!
<k>
<p>
OK, that's all for now!
<wait 250>
I feel silly talking about
this kind of stuff.
<k>
<p>
And, Mario... <wait 250>I hope you're not
spending all your time trying
to talk to little old me.
<k>
<p>

other things you're supposed
to be doing, right?
<k> bunny_teresa_12 Machi #2859 bunny_teresa_13 <p>

OK.<wait 250> It'll cost you 10 piantas
to play, OK?
<o> bunny_teresa_35 <p>
You don't have enough
piantas!<wait 250> Save some up and
then come talk to me!
<k> bunny_teresa_36 <p>
OK!<wait 250> Stay on your toes!
<k> bunny_teresa_37 Good luck!
<wait 1000> bunny_teresa_38 The Plane Game? 
<k>
<p>
In this game, you turn into a
paper airplane and compete
to see how far you can fly.
<k>
<p>
The farther you fly, the
more piantas you win!
<k>
<p>
And, if you land on one of
the moving platforms, you'll
get a bonus!
<k>
<p>
If you land on a penalty
platform, you'll lose piantas,
so be careful when landing.
<k>
<p>
The best way to boost your
winnings is to collect lots of
piantas while flying!
<k>
<p>
Good luck!
<k>
<o> bunny_teresa_39 OK, the Paper Game.
<k>
<p>
In this game, you have to get
paper-thin to avoid the wind
and get to the finish.
<k>
<p>
If you don't turn paper-thin
as soon as the wind starts
blowing...
<k>
<p>
You'll get blown away!
<wait 250>
If you fall off the track,
you'll lose.
<k>
<p>
The higher you place, the
more piantas you win.
<k>
<p>
And there are also bonuses
associated with your place,
so finish as quick as possible.
<k>
<p>
The quickest way to get to
the end is to choose paths
that don't require jumping!
<k>
<p>
Good luck!
<k>
<o> bunny_teresa_40 OK, the Tube Game.
<k>
<p>
In this game you have to roll
up into a tube to navigate
the difficult courses.
<k>
<p>
You'll have to be able to
dodge obstacles and
navigate narrow paths.
<k>
<p>
The faster you reach the
end, the more piantas you
earn...
<k>
<p>
And if you finish without
falling off the track, you'll
earn a technical bonus!
<k>
<p>
Pick up as many piantas on
the track as you can to
boost your total!
<k>
<p>
Good luck!
<k>
<o> bunny_teresa_41 Oh, the Boat Game?
<k>
<p>
In this game, you become a
boat and dodge obstacles as
you sail to the finish.
<k>
<p>
Drifting boats don't stop
immediately, so keep a
steady hand on the tiller.
<k>
<p>
The faster you finish, the
more piantas you win...
<k>
<p>
You'll get a technical bonus
for finishing without hitting
the whirlpools.
<k>
<p>
Pick up the waterborne
piantas to boost your
winnings!
<k>
<p>
Good luck!
<k>

<k> kuji_bomb_038 ...Something very unhappy has

<p>
You wouldn't happen to know

<wait 250>
A very unhappy thing.

<p>
There has been <col cc0000ff>foul play

in the Happy Lucky Lottery.
<wait 250>
The clock was tampered with.

<o> kuji_bomb_042 <select 0 -1 0 40>
Yes, I did it!
Don't be ridiculous! kuji_bomb_043 <p>
Happy Lucky Lottery is only
happy and lucky because the
players are happy and lucky.
<k>
<p>
And they don't ever cheat...
<wait 250>
I mean...changing the clock...

 kuji_bomb_044 <select 0 -1 0 40>
OK, yeah, I did.
Nope, wasn't me! kuji_bomb_045 <p>

No way, man! kuji_bomb_047 <p>

<wait 250>
Just tell me the truth and
I'll forgive you.

All right, fine, I did! kuji_bomb_049 <p>

<p>
...But I just don't know how
it could have happened, bom.
<wait 250>
How unlucky...<wait 250>and unhappy.
<k>
<p>
To get it going again,
everyone will have to buy

<k>
<p>
Do you want a new number

<o> kuji_bomb_050 <select 0 1 0 40>

I just hope that nothing like

Well, I can't start the

<k> luigi_npc_02 Hi, I guess.<wait 250> I'm Jerry.
<wait 250>
I'm a Bob-omb from Plumpbelly
Village. <wait 250>Nice meeting you.
<k>
<p>
Sorry I sound so down, but
you would be too if you saw
Luigi dressed as a bride.
<k>
<p>
I'm serious.<wait 250> It scarred me.
<wait 250>
It was honestly scarier than
that giant snake-thing.
<k>
<p>
I feel I now have a moral
duty to stop Luigi from ever
dressing as a bride again.
<k>
<p>
I have to protect the world
from my fate.<wait 250> That's why I'm
sticking close to this guy.
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Rogueport's west side.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
This is totally the friendlier
face of Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
Not that it's, y'know, a great
place to raise a family, but
it's good for Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
The corner with the fountain
is definitely the most restful
spot in Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
This area is controlled by
Don Pianta, head of the
Pianta syndicate...
<k>
<p>
Yeah. <wait 250>The shop and parlor
here are totally fronts for
his "business."
<k> マフィア１ <keyxon>
That's Vinny, of the Piantas.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
That guy there's his brother,
Tony. <wait 250>They're super-tight.
<k>
<p>
They live for their boss,
seriously. <wait 250>They'd put their
lives on the line for him.
<k> マフィア２ <keyxon>
That's Tony, of the Piantas.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
That guy there's his brother,
Vinny. <wait 250>They're super-tight.
<k>
<p>
Tony's a wise guy who doesn't
mind mixing it up a bit, if
you know what I mean...
<k> マフィア３ <keyxon>
That's Rocko, of the Piantas.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's the muscle that keeps
the parlor moving smoothly.
<k>
<p>
He's new to the Pianta
syndicate. <wait 250>I think he's still
low man on the totem pole.
<k> マフィアボス <keyxon>
That's the boss, Don Pianta.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
It's true what they say about
power: this guy's got POISE.
<k>
<p>
But he's got a mean streak
a mile wide...<wait 250> They call him
"The Don of Untimely Death."
<k>
<p>
Still, he's got a really soft
spot for his daughter,
Francesca...
<k> マフィアボスカジノ <keyxon>
That's Don Pianta, the former
syndicate boss.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's retired
now, but he's still a force.
<k>
<p>
He must be here because he's
all worried about Frankie and
Francesca, huh?
<k>
<p>
Or...maybe he's just worried
that Francesca's cracking
the whip on poor old Frankie!
<k> 店員 <keyxon>
That's Peeka, a Boo that
works at Westside Goods.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She's so pretty...for a Boo.
<k>
<p>
I think her sister's Lahla,
the Boo who works at the
Pianta Parlor.
<k> モニー <keyxon>
That's Don Pianta's daughter,
Francesca.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> She's head-over-
heels for Frankie.
<k>
<p>
Seems like she's got Frankie
on a pretty short leash, but...
<wait 250>
Hey, they're happy, right?
<k> ピートン <keyxon>
That's Frankie, a member of
the Pianta syndicate.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's
a MONSTER when he's angry.
<k>
<p>
Everybody in Rogueport talks
about his and Francesca's
public displays of affection.
<k> グルメボム兵 <keyxon>
A new day, a new chance!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
That's Lucky, who runs the
Happy Lucky Lottery.
<k>
<p>
He's a real stickler for the
rules, so if he catches you
cheating...
<k>
<p>
Well, just be careful, Mario!
<k> ルイージ <keyxon>
I'm sure you know this, but
that's your brother, Luigi.
<wait 250>
Duh.
<k>
<p>
It seems like he's
suspenders-deep in his own
crazy adventure right now.
<k>
<p>
If you ask him, he'll tell you
all about it...<wait 300>but I wonder how
much of his story is true...
<k> バニーテレサ <keyxon>
That's Lahla, a Boo cutie.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She works the desk at the
Pianta Parlor.
<k>
<p>
Her sister's Peeka, the Boo
who works in the shop.<wait 250> I hear
they both used to be models.
<k> 客１ <keyxon>
That's a Goomba who really
likes this parlor.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He always
seems to be in a good mood.
<k>
<p>
I wouldn't mind winning like
he does every now and then.
<wait 250>
Lucky stiff.
<k> 客４ <keyxon>
That's a parlor customer.
<wait 250>
She's a Squeek, it looks like.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Good to see a girl in here.
<k>
<p>
It's a good sign if this
place is safe enough for
regular folks to go to.
<k> ロテン４ <keyxon>
This guy really likes...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
No, he totally LOVES the
Happy Lucky Lottery!
<k>
<p>
He wakes up each day with
one thing on his mind:
<wait 250>
that day's winning number!
<k> キノピオ女Ａ <keyxon>
That's a parlor customer.
<k>
<p>
I think she leaves her hubbie
home with the kids so she
can play here all day long.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, that's healthy.
<k> キノピオ女Ｂ <keyxon>
That's a Toad from the west
side.
<k>
<p>
She's a big theatergoer, and
apparently she's also a
raving fan of Flurrie's.
<k> キノピオＡ <keyxon>
That guy's a frustrated
novelist.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's got great ideas,
but he ruins them on paper.
<k>
<p>
I think he just psyches
himself out.<wait 300> I mean, he's got
the talent and all...
<k> キノピオ子供Ａ <keyxon>
I think this kid lives here.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's afraid to go outside, so
he spends all day in here.
<k>
<p>
He's got some family issues,
I think,<wait 250> but it's not our
place to stick our noses in.
<k>
<p>
Kids this age tend to
overdramatize their problems
anyway, know what I mean?
<k> キノピオ子供Ｂ <keyxon>
That's a neighborhood kid.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He seems to like going out
and exploring new places.
<k>
<p>
...But he does seem to have
a gripe about his family...
<wait 300>
I wonder what it is...
<k> ノコノコＡ <keyxon>
That Koopa lives here.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He must've been born lucky,
'cause he ALWAYS succeeds.
<k>
<p>
He has all the money he'll
ever need, but I think he's
still unfulfilled somehow.
<k>
<p>
Hmm...<wait 300> Then again, that
doesn't surprise me, since
he spends all day in bed.
<k>
<p>
It just goes to show, you
can't buy happiness, and you
should occasionally leave bed.
<k> クリボー１ <keyxon>
That's Goomez, the Goomba.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He must be totally tired.
<wait 250>
He's ALWAYS resting here.
<k>
<p>
Who can blame him, though?
<wait 250>
We could all use some
downtime, am I right?
<k> チェリー <keyxon>
That's Jerry, Luigi's Bob-omb
buddy.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's a little different
from most Bob-ombs.
<k>
<p>
He's really burning with a
righteous fire, and I think he's
seen some...horrible...things.
<k>
<p>
Speaking of which, I wonder
if I'll ever be a bride...
<wait 250>
Hee hee hee hee hee!
<k>  

gor_04_000 I tell you, I like just standing
here gazing at the train more
than I would like riding it.
<k>
<p>
'Cause, if I were to ride, I
wouldn't get to see how cool
its main engine looks!
<k>
<p>
...Yeah. Looking at it's better.
<wait 250>
But if I could just afford a
ticket, I might ride it once...
<k> gor_04_001 I tell you, I like just standing

<k> gor_04_002 All I ever think about is how
this train cuts through the
wind as it races across plains.
<k>
<p>
Like a torpedo on earth,
slicing through the
relentless winds...
<k>
<p>
Doesn't it just fire you
up inside?
<k>
<p>
I don't have the money yet,
but my dream is to one

Whoa...<wait 250> I'm gonna try to
save up my money, too.
<k>
<p>
I know it won't be easy.
<k>
<p>
But one day, I'm going to
ride this Excess Express!
<wait 250>
I promise you that!
<k>
<p>
Of course, even then, I'll
never grow tired of gazing
at this engine.

Princess Peach, don't you

mail!<wait 250> I'd say that one is
from the princess.
<k> gor_04_mail6_00_chu Mario!<wait 250> Is that an e-mail
from your princess?
<k> gor_04_mail6_01 <housou>
Mario,
I now know where I'm being
held.
<k>
<p>
I'm on the moon.<wait 250> Yes.
<wait 250>
The moon that floats out
in space.
<k>
<p>
And I've learned something
even more horrifying. 
<k>
<p>
In order to resurrect the
monster's spirit, they need
my...
<k> gor_04_mail6_02_kur The MOON? <wait 250>That's totally
nuts! <wait 250>Princess Peach is on
the MOON?
<k>
<p>
I mean, that actually sounds
pretty cool!<wait 250> But why is her
e-mail cut off...
<k>
<p>
Omigosh!<wait 250> You don't think
something happened to her,
do you?
<k> gor_04_mail6_02_nok Ummm... <wait 250>Th-The moon?
<wait 250>
Princess Peach is on the
moon?<wait 250> Golly...
<k>
<p>
That actually sounds neat!
<wait 250>
But why is her e-mail cut off?
<k>
<p>
Wait a minute! <wait 250>What if
something happened to her!
<k> gor_04_mail6_02_win Oh, my! <wait 250>The moon?<wait 250> Mercy!
<wait 250>
What an odd place for a
princess to be...
<k>
<p>
How marvelous!<wait 250> But why is
her e-mail cut off?
<k>
<p>
Gracious! <wait 250>Might something
have happened to her?
<k> gor_04_mail6_02_yos Whoa! The moon?<wait 250> For real?
<wait 250>
The princess is up there?
<k>
<p>
Man, that is so COOL!

But why is her e-mail cut
off like that?
<k>
<p>
Hang on! <wait 250>You don't think...
<wait 250>
something happened to her?
<k> gor_04_mail6_02_viv Th-The moon?<wait 250> Princess Peach

<k>
<p>
Well, that's good to know!
<wait 250>
But why would her e-mail be

<p>
Wait just a tick! <wait 250>You don't
suppose something's happened
to the poor girl, do you?
<k> gor_04_mail6_02_chu Mmmm...<wait 250> The moon, is it?
<wait 250>
Peach is on the moon?
<k>
<p>
Sounds intriguing!<wait 250> But why

You can board intercity
trains or blimps here.

<p>
The Excess Express bound for
Poshley Heights is nice and
shiny, isn't it? <wait 250>Wow!
<k>
<p>
I bet all the town kids are
just DYING to ride it at
least once, y'know?
<k>
<p>
That blimp way over at the
airfield looks super-cool,
too. <wait 250>Blimps are awesome!

That's Porter, the station
manager here in Rogueport.

He checks train tickets.
<k>
<p>
I hear he loves trains so
much that he has like, a
billion model trains at home.

Maybe he's just using his
adulthood to buy all the
things he wanted as a kid...
<k> 飛行船係員 <keyxon>
That's Stewart, the blimp
conductor. <dkey><wait 300></dkey>His job is to check
blimp passengers' tickets.
<k>
<p>
I hear he loved the sea even
as a child and wanted to
become a sailor...
<k>

But now he's sailing the
skies instead...
<k>
<p>
I guess his dream sorta came
true, huh?<wait 250> He's like an air
sailor, or something...

That's Laki, a train-loving
Lakitu.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> All this guy does is
sit here and watch trains.
<k>
<p>
I'm sure he'd love to ride
the Excess Express, but he
can't afford a ticket.
<k>

It'd be cool if he saved up
enough to ride it just once
in his life, y'know?

She's fixated on romantic

All you gotta do is ask!

In fact, it kinda looks like
he's dying to tell you stuff,
so you oughta rap with him!

Hello there, Mario!
I am now on holiday, traveling
in the Mushroom Kingdom.
<k>
<p>
In my travels, I came into
possession of a mystical map...
a treasure map, actually.
<k>
<p>
It was inside a box I got
from an old merchant in a
town called Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
But since it would be too
difficult for me to try to go
find treasure all by myself...
<k>
<p>
I thought you could help
me hunt for it! You will,
of course, won't you?
<k>
<p>
I've included the map with
this letter, so please bring
it with you when you come.
<k>
<p>
I'll meet you at Rogueport.
(That means you MUST come!)
<pos 300 60>

<k> mac_0_012 Excuse me... <wait 250>Sir?

<wait 250>
Please prepare to disembark.

think I ever wanna stop!
<k> stg4_gra_02 So, you figured it out by
now, right, Slick?<wait 250> Your body
and name belong to me now!
<k>
<p>
See, I've got the power to
change my shape into anyone
I want...<wait 250> It comes in handy.
<k>
<p>
But to REALLY be someone,
I need to take their name
and body, too!
<k>
<p>
Which means you turn into a
shadow and can't use your
name! <wait 250>Tough break, Slick!
<k>
<p>
That's not enough, either...
<wait 250>
I aim to erase you for good!
<k> stg4_gra_03 I guess it'd be unsporting to
ruin you without a challenge...
<wait 250>
so I'll give you one chance.
<k>
<p>
If you guess my real name,
then I'll give you back your
name and body!
<k>
<p>
What do you say, Slick?
<wait 250>
This'll be fun, right?

<p>
Now, guess!<wait 250> What's my name?

battle, hear?<wait 250> NO RUNNING!
<k> stg4_gra_05 Hey, what's up, Slick?
<wait 250>
Been waiting for you!
<k>
<p>
I would've done this back in
town, but that wouldn't have
looked very good, would it?
<k> stg4_gra_06_viv So...<wait 250> This is the one who stole
your name and body...
<k>
<p>
...Hmm.<wait 100> He looks sort of
familiar to me.
<k> stg4_gra_07 All right, can the chatter!
<wait 250>
Here's the deal: you get your
chance, then I stomp you!
<k>
<p>
If you guess my real name,
then you get your body and
name back.
<k>
<p>
Fire away, No-Name!
<k> stg4_gra_08 Wrong!<wait 250> This is too much fun!
<wait 250>
Yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk yuk!
<wait 250>
Are you even trying?
<k>
<p>
Well, whatever.<wait 250> Get ready to
meet your doom, Slick!
<k> stg4_gra_09 Hey, Slick!<wait 250> Time to cancel
your magazine subscriptions,
'cause you're getting erased!
<k>
<p>
But first, please amuse me
with one more guess...
<k>
<p>
It really gives me joy to
watch you squirm in futility
as you try to guess my name!
<k>
<p>
So...<wait 250>hit me one more time!
<k> stg4_gra_10 Oh, man, I LOVE it!
<wait 250>
The joy just never ends...
<wait 250>
Or does it?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, I guess I should just
get rid of you for good.
<wait 250>
Prepare to meet your doom!

I hear some of the villagers
go there to collect herbs.

If there were like, a big hole

fall in without seeing it.

Flurrie would float right

not worried...

I'll give it my best...
<k>  

stg1_hei_00 Well, here we are! <wait 250>The Petal
Meadows, where folks say a
Crystal Star hides.
<k>
<p>
Woo hoo!<wait 250> Here we go, Mario!<wait 250> 
The start of our adventure!
<wait 250>
This is completely awesome!
<k> stg1_hei_01 Whoa! <wait 250>What was that?
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
Ooh! <wait 250>Is that a...<wait 250> Wow! 
<wait 250>
Mario!<wait 250> Look!!!
<k> stg1_hei_02 Totally incredible...
<wait 250>
I've never seen anything
that humongous before.
<k>
<p>
It looked kinda scary, too.<wait 250> 
Weird... <wait 250>Professor Frankly
said this place was peaceful.
<k>
<p>
Wow! <wait 250>Crazy! <wait 250>We just started,
and already there's intrigue! 
<wait 250>
C'mon, Mario! <wait 250>Let's go!
<k> stg1_hei_02_01 <kanban>
Here beginneth the path
to dread Hooktail Castle. 
Weaklings, retreateth!

Ye who seeketh to proceed:
a power of two must hitteth
both switches simultaneously.

The Moon Stone is in place.
<k> kpa_stg2_000 I'm pretty sure it's just
up ahead here...
<k> kpa_stg2_001 Right as usual, Lord Bowser!
<k>
<p>
We just got word that
Princess Peach was spotted
in the town up ahead.
<k> kpa_stg2_002 Good! Yes, very good.
<wait 250>
Then I'm off! <wait 250>These fools
don't know what's coming!

As part of my research, I did
go back to many of the
places we visited...
<k>
<p>
And I saw everyone we
traveled with, too!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
Ah, the Petal Meadows.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
A plateau surrounded by hills
far to the east of Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
It's mild and pleasant here
all year round.<wait 250> I love it!
<wait 300>
Doesn't it feel nice?
<k>
<p>
...Oh, hey, and Mario?
<wait 300>
If you hit a tree, sometimes
something good falls out.
<k>
<p>
I know that came out of left
field, but I mean it!<wait 250> If you
see a tree, smack it!
<k>  

stg1_hei_02_02 Oh! <wait 250>One more thing, Mario!
<wait 300>
If you ever find yourself,
like, wondering what to do...
<k>
<p>
Just press <icon PAD_X_ON 0.5 -20 35 -10> and use my
Tattle ability, OK?
<k>
<p>
I might be able to look up
some useful info that'll
help us on our adventure!
<k> stg1_hei_03 Ummm... <wait 250>Excuse me...
<k> stg1_hei_04 It's... <wait 250>It's Mario, right?
<k>
<p>
Look, I... <wait 250>Ummmm...
<k>
<p>
See, the thing is, I've been
waiting here in the hope of
getting to speak with you.
<k>
<p>
I have to ask you something,
and you can say no, but I'm
going to throw it out there.
<k> stg1_hei_05 Ummmmmm...
<k>
<p>
See...
<k>
<p>
I was wondering...
<k>
<p>
Would you...
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>
OH, PLEASE TAKE ME WITH
YOU TO FIGHT HOOKTAIL!<wait 50> 
PLEASE! <wait 50>I'M BEGGING YOU!
</dynamic>
<k> stg1_hei_05_1 Sorry about that.<wait 250> See...
<wait 250>
My dad...<wait 250> He went off to
battle Hooktail long ago.
<k>
<p>
...But he never came back.
<k> stg1_hei_05_2 I miss him, of course... <wait 250>I miss
him badly.<wait 250> But this isn't just
about avenging my dad.
<k>
<p>
Well, no... <wait 250>That's not true.<wait 250> 
Revenge is a part of it,
I guess. <wait 250>A big part.
<k>
<p>
But the truth is, I want to
finish what Dad started.<wait 250> For
his sake. <wait 250>For everyone's sake.
<k> stg1_hei_06 I... <wait 250>Man, this is embarrassing...
<wait 250>
See, everyone always says I'm
a crybaby... <wait 250>A weakling.
<k>
<p>
But if I can defeat Hooktail...<wait 250> 
Well, I won't be those things.<wait 250> 
I'll be strong, like my dad.
<k> stg1_hei_06_1 I know it'll be dangerous,
but I still want to go!
<wait 250>
Please, Mario!
<o> stg1_hei_07 For real? <wait 250>No kidding?
<wait 250>
Yes!<wait 250> Thank you so much!
<wait 250>
You won't regret this!
<k> stg1_hei_09 OK, Mario!
<wait 250>
Let's get going!
<k> stg1_hei_10 What? <wait 250>But... <wait 250>But why?
<wait 250>
Why can't I go?
<o> stg1_hei_11 Well, if that's how you feel...
<wait 250>
I'm not giving up hope, though.
<wait 250>
I promised myself I wouldn't.
<k>
<p>
Ummm... <wait 250>So, if...
<wait 250>
If you change your mind,
Mario, let me know.<wait 250> OK?
<k>
<p>
I'll be over there polishing
my shell. <wait 250>Can't have an
adventure with a dull shell.
<k> stg1_hei_12 Are you taking me along?!?
<o> stg1_hei_12_yesno1 <select 0 1 0 40>
Sure, come along!
Nope, sorry. stg1_hei_12_yesno2 <select 0 -1 0 40>
I don't think so.
C'mon, you can go! stg1_hei_12_01 Koops...
<k> stg1_hei_12_02 Oh... <wait 250>Golly...<wait 250> Umm...<wait 250> Hi...
<wait 250>
Hi, Koopie... <wait 250>Koopie Koo...
<wait 250>
Did you overhear all that?
<k> stg1_hei_12_03 Well, part of it.<wait 250> Koops...
<wait 250>
I THOUGHT I heard you say
you're off to fight Hooktail...
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250>you're joking, right?
<wait 250>
I mean, you're not exactly a
powerhouse...<wait 250> He'll eat you up!
<k> stg1_hei_12_04 I know, Koopie Koo.
<wait 500>
But I want to be tougher.
<wait 250>
For you...
<k>
<p>
So I have to do this...
<k> stg1_hei_12_05 No, Koops, you don't.
<wait 250>
I mean, going off to some
dangerous place? <wait 250>It's...
<k>
<p>
It's stupid. <wait 250>So what if you're
timid? <wait 250>And sort of a crybaby.
<wait 250>
I don't care about all that.
<k>
<p>
I just want you to be you.
<wait 250>
So, don't go...
<k> stg1_hei_12_06 Sorry, Koopie Koo...
<wait 250>
I've made up my mind.
<k>
<p>
No need to worry, though!
<wait 250>
After all, I'm traveling with
Mario. <wait 250>He's the man!

I swear to you...
<wait 250>
I will come back to you a
stronger Koopa!
<k> stg1_hei_12_10 Well, Mario, that's that,
I guess. <wait 250>No turning back!
<wait 250>
Hooktail's castle awaits!
<k> stg1_gon_44_kur Mario? Are you OK?
<wait 250>
You're totally shaking...
<wait 250>
Do you need a bathroom?
<k> stg1_gon_44_nok Something wrong, Mario?
<wait 250>
You're...um...shaking.
<wait 250>
Are you feeling all right?
<k> stg1_gon_44_01_kur Ooh, is that a Mailbox SP?<wait 250> 
Cool! <wait 250>With the light?
<wait 250>
Hey, who's that mail from?
<k> stg1_gon_44_01_nok That's a new Mailbox SP,
isn't it?<wait 250> Wow, neat!
<wait 250>
Did you get some mail?
<k> stg1_gon_45 <housou>
My Dearest Mario,
I send this letter in the hope
that it reaches you safely.
<k>
<p>
I am being held against my
will in some strange place.
<k>
<p>
Though I do not know where
I am, I remain unharmed and
in relative comfort.
<k>
<p>
Those who have captured me
seem to be after the map I
sent to you earlier.
<k>
<p>
They may be hoping to use it
to find objects they call
the "Crystal Stars."
<k>
<p>
I do not know what they are
planning, but I have a feeling
it is not anything positive.
<k>
<p>
Mario, please collect these
Crystal Stars before they do.
You must!
<k>
<p>
They are already aware that
you have the map, so please
be very careful.
<k>
<p>
And please... Don't worry
about me.
          -Princess Peach-
<k> stg1_gon_46_kur Wow! <wait 250>Wait a second...
<wait 250>
Isn't that from Princess
Peach?<wait 250> THE princess?
<k>
<p>
So that means she's OK!
<wait 250>
At least she's not hurt...
<k> stg1_gon_46_nok Wow...<wait 250> You got mail from
a princess. <wait 250>That's so cool!
<k>
<p>
So, anyway, she's unhurt!
<wait 250>
That's good, at least...
<k> stg1_gon_47_kur But it sounds like whoever
kidnapped Princess Peach is
also after the Crystal Stars...
<k> stg1_gon_47_nok But I didn't like the sound
of those kidnappers looking
for the Crystal Stars as well...

Koops has joined your party!
<k> lecture_friends_04_0_1 <system>

Koops's Abilities: A Primer
<k> lecture_friends_04_1 <system>
Press <icon PAD_X_ON 0.5 -20 35 -10> to shoot out his shell.<wait 250> 
Use it to retrieve distant
items and hit switches!
<k>
<o> lecture_friends_05 <p>
If you hold <icon PAD_X_ON 0.5 -20 35 -10>, you can hold his
shell in one place after
shooting it!
<k>
<o> lecture_friends_05_1 <p>
After holding his shell in
place, release <icon PAD_X_ON 0.5 -20 35 -10> to fire the
shell past Mario and attack!
<k>
<o> lecture_friends_05_2 <p>
You can even hold Koops's
shell in place, move Mario,
and then release the shell!
<k>
<o> lecture_friends_05_3 <p>
So, remember!<wait 250> Hold <icon PAD_X_ON 0.5 -20 35 -10> to shoot
the shell out and hold it in
one place!
<k>
<o> lecture_friends_06 <p>
In battle, Koops can fight by
your side, striking foes with
his main move: the Shell Toss.
<k>
<p>
He can also strike all ground-
bound enemies in one attack
with his Power Shell!
<k>

To swap your partner in the

The river running through
here totally makes the air
crisp and refreshing.
<k>
<p>
Hey, and by the way, Mario,
have you tried checking the
grass around here?
<k>
<p>
Sometimes those clumps of
grass hide good stuff, so
always check them with <icon PAD_A 0.6 -20 34 -10>!
<k> ƒmƒRƒ^ƒƒE <keyxon>
That's Koops, from Petalburg.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's been waiting here,
hoping to join you.
<k>
<p>
He's a bit green, but braver
than I thought...<wait 300> I'll have to
rethink my first impression.
<k>
<p>
I mean, he seems totally
earnest, know what I mean?
<wait 300>
We should take him along.
<k>  

stg1_hei_14 Not to be a total downer,
but our attacks don't seem
to be working, Mario!

If we don't attack with more

This path leads to Shhwonk
Fortress.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> ...Is it just me,
or is this area darker?

There are enemies around, so
if you feel weak, remember to
take it easy, OK?
<k>  

stg1_hei_13 Wow, what's the deal, here?<wait 250> 
Our attacks don't seem to be
doing any damage at all!
<k>
<p>
I think maybe we ought to
retreat for the time being,
Mario.<wait 50> C'mon, let's go.
<k> stg1_hei_15 Nope, it just won't open.
<wait 250>
I wonder what we should do...

This is part of Shhwonk
Fortress.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> We got a couple
pedestals here. <wait 250>That's it.

It looks pretty decent, but
this place is actually insanely
old, did you know that?

I'd say it was built about...
<wait 250>
a thousand years ago.<wait 300> Yup.

<k>
<p>
Oh, yeah, and listen, Mario...
<wait 300>
Remember, you don't have to
attack every enemy you see.
<k>
<p>
If you have low HP, you might
just wanna avoid them.
<wait 300>
That's Exploring 101, y'know?

there, too.<wait 300> If your HP and FP
are low, hit it, OK?

stg1_hei_20 <boss><se 2>
Mmmm hmmm hoo ha ha!<wait 250> 
You're the first contestants
I've seen in a while.
<k>
<p>
If you've come all the way
here to Shhwonk Fortress,
you must want stone keys.
<k>
<p>
And if THAT'S the case, then
you must compete against me.
<k>
<p>
If you win, I'll let you through
to where the stone keys rest.
<k>
<p>
However, if you lose, you will
suffer a terrible fate. <wait 250>And
by "terrible," I mean awful.

Suspicious statue...<wait 300> I'm pretty

Hey, I just remembered
something I read about this
place in a book!
<k>
<p>
Whenever the villagers were
confronted with a monster,
they'd hide in this fortress...
<k>
<p>
I guess there's a little bit
of history everywhere you
look, huh, Mario?
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're in Shhwonk Fortress.

I wouldn't mind getting out
of here for some fresh air
soon, you know what I mean?
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There sure are a lot of
Fuzzies living here in
Shhwonk Fortress...

I totally hate dark places...

Plus, it's dark, and cramped,
and it smells totally bad...
<wait 300>
This place is not cool, Mario.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
All this moisture makes this
place really moldy-smelling.
<wait 300>
And what's that other stink?

<wait 250>

I let that happen!
<k> stg6_hom_01_02 This whole Zip Toad thing
was just a means to an end!
<wait 250>
It's me, suckers!<wait 250> Doopliss!
<k>
<p>
Beldam's plan to gooify Mario
didn't exactly work, so I'll
be cutting and running now!

<p>
I'll leave the rest to Beldam!
<wait 250>
See ya, suckers!
<k> stg6_rsh_211 Urrrrrrrrrrrrrrmph!
<wait 250>
I'd been cooped up in there
breathing stale air too long.
<k>
<p>
I wanted to go out and take
a walk so I could build up
an appetite for dinner.
<k> stg6_hom_00 Ah, my dear <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>!
<wait 250>
Our suspect was not only a
fake Zip Toad...
<k>
<p>
He was some monstrous being
in a white sheet, which was
EXACTLY as I suspected!
<k>
<p>
Too bad he gave us the slip
like that, though... <wait 250>He was
rather a slippery sort...
<k>

We could have questioned
him about all of that

<wait 250>
I wanna drive it! <wait 250>Right now!
<k> stg6_hom_04 Oh, no!<wait 250> What'll we do?
<k>
<p>
Someone's lifted the
drawbridge!<wait 250> The train can't
leave the station like this!
<k> stg6_hom_05 I saw a suspicious-looking
shadowy person wearing a
hat go into the station...
<k>
<p>
He must've gone down to the
bridge-control room to flip
the switch there...
<k>
<p>
But that switch hasn't been
used in so long, I don't know
where the control room is...
<k>
<p>
So, um...<wait 250> It's probably against
protocol to ask a passenger
to do this, but...
<k>
<p>
Since you ARE the famous
Mario and all, could you go
find and throw that switch?
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
Maybe?
<o>
 stg6_hom_06 <p>
Really?<wait 250> That would be super!
<k>
<p>
Well, here's the station key!
<k> stg6_hom_08 Oh, thank you so much!
<k> stg6_hom_09 <p>
Oh...<wait 250> Well, now what are we
going to do...
<k> stg6_hom_10 Could you go down to the
control room in the station
and flip the bridge switch?
<o> stg6_hom_10_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Sure thing!
No, sorry. stg6_hom_11 Please go find the control
room and flip the bridge
switch.<wait 250> You're our only hope!

<wait 250>
Now we'll get you guys rolling!

<k> stg6_eki_03 This is Riverside Station.
<wait 250>
We've stopped to refuel.
<k>
<p>
There's a quaint drawbridge
here from when pleasure
boats cruised the canal.
<k>
<p>
But it hasn't been used since
the canal was dried up and
turned to pasture...
<k> stg6_eki_04 ALLLL ABOOOOOARD!

I order you to do some

<k> kpa_stg1_014 Ahh...<wait 250> MAN, I'm attractive!<wait 250> 
Every time I look at this, I'm
overwhelmed by its coolness!

When I take over the world,
I'm gonna stick these statues
all OVER the place! <wait 250>Yeah!
<k> kpa_stg1_014_1 Boy...<wait 250> Do I even HAVE a

Although...<wait 250>this thing could

Now, out with it!<wait 250> Why have
you called me here?
<k> kpa_stg1_025 Please, Your Grumpiness!<wait 250> 
Don't be so impatient with
your poor servant.

<p>
Ahem...

every time that guy blows
his nose, or what? <wait 250>Sheesh!
<k> kpa_stg1_027 Yes, well, you see, my lord...
<wait 250>
Apparently Mario is hunting
for an amazing treasure.
<k> kpa_stg1_028 Tuh-<wait 250>Treasure?!?
<k> kpa_stg1_029 Yes, Mario has gone in search
of star-shaped jewels known
as the Crystal Stars.
<k>
<p>
I'm researching just what
they are...<wait 250>but there's no
question of their high value.
<k> kpa_stg1_030 The Crystal Stars, you say?
<wait 250>
They sound like good world-
conquering tools! <wait 250>I want 'em!
<k>
<p>
Hmm...<wait 250> Yes...<wait 250> Very good...<wait 250> 
Continue researching this
for me, you brainy hag, you.
<k> kpa_stg1_031 Yes, sir. <wait 250>Thank you, sir.
<wait 250>
Leave it to me.

By the way, Lord Bowser...

Why do you ask?

<p>
Ugh!<wait 250> I almost threw up just

But...<wait 250>why do you ask?
<k> kpa_stg1_034 Well,<wait 250> during my Mario recon,
I stopped in a lovely place
called Petal Meadows.
<k>
<p>
I was planning on taking
everyone there for a picnic,
having some eggs and toast...

Of course, I wouldn't think of
sending out invites without
asking you first, Lord Bowser!

do such a thing?<wait 250> Besides me?
<k> kpa_stg1_043 I'm afraid we don't have that
information quite yet...

The investigation's ongoing.

One thing is most certainly
confirmed, however:<wait 250> the
princess has been kidnapped.
<k> kpa_stg1_044 Under NO circumstances is
ANYONE allowed to kidnap
her without MY say-so!!!

bad type, if you ask me.
<wait 300>
...But who knows for sure?
<k> ランペル <keyxon>
That's Doopliss, who I guess is
a Shadow Siren now...<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Not a
bad Frankly impersonator.
<k>
<p>
Gosh, I hope nothing bad's
happened to the REAL
Professor Frankly...
<k>
<p>
And why is Doopliss working
with the Shadow Sirens,
anyway? <wait 250>Too many questions!

<wait 250>
What is it, you think?
<k> stg8_las_32_nok Wow, it's...really huge...
<wait 250>
What is it, anyway?
<k> stg8_las_32_win It's simply massive...
<wait 250>
What could it be?
<k> stg8_las_32_yos Whoa, it's gigantic, huh?
<wait 250>
What the heck is it?
<k> stg8_las_32_viv What...<wait 250>IS it?
<k> stg8_las_32_bom It's absolutely titanic...

What in blazes is it?
<k> stg8_las_32_chu It's so big...<wait 250>but what is it?
<k> stg8_las_32_01 <system>
There's an opening here for
a key of some sort.
<k> stg8_las_33_kur Wow! <wait 250>It's moving!

<k> stg8_las_35_chu What was that?
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
How could there be such a
huge tower underground?
<wait 250>
And why was it built...?
<k>
<p>
There seem to be a lot of
rooms here...<wait 250>and every one
contains a riddle...
<k>  

stg8_las_36 <kanban>
Four stones, twin stones...
<col 202060ff>
Master of Shadow and Dark...
</col>
Two are one, one is two...
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There's something written on
the wall.<wait 250> Based on that
message, I'd say...
<k>
<p>
Maybe if we break a block
here, it'll do something to a
block in another room?
<k>  

stg8_las_37 <kanban>
All you see isn't all there be...
<col 202060ff>
Stones Have Power of Stars...
</col>
Touch it to pass through it...
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There's something written on
the wall.<wait 250> Based on that
message, I'd say...
<k>
<p>
There's something fishy about
the wall here?<wait 250> Uh, maybe?
<wait 250>
We oughta investigate...
<k>  

stg8_las_38 <kanban>
Beyond, beyond, beyond...
<col 202060ff>
Complete All Seven...
</col>
Before, before...
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There's something written on
the wall.<wait 250> Based on that
message, I'd say...
<k>
<p>
That word "beyond" probably
refers to away from the door.
<wait 250>
So that means the left block.
<k>
<p>
So then the word "before"
must refer to the right block.
<wait 250>
Are you with me, Mario?
<k>
<p>
Still, the way they repeat
those words must have some
meaning too, don'tcha think?
<k>  

stg8_las_39 <kanban>
The unseen may yet be felt...
<col 202060ff>
So That We, the Great Ones...
</col>
Be it here? Be it there?
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There's something written on
the wall.<wait 250> Based on that
message, I'd say...
<k>
<p>
...There's definitely something
in the center of the room,
don'tcha think?
<k>
<p>
But what are we supposed to
do with something we can't
see? <wait 250>This is insanity!
<k>  

stg8_las_40 <kanban>
Four stones, twin stones...
<col 202060ff>
Can Live Again by the Stone...
</col>
Two are one, one is two...
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There's something written on
the wall.<wait 250> Based on that
message, I'd say...
<k>
<p>
Maybe if we break a block
here, it'll do something to a
block in another room?
<k>  

stg8_las_41 <kanban>
Straight on, straight onward...
<col 202060ff>

</col>
Destroy all in your path...
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There's something written on
the wall.<wait 250> Based on that
message, I'd say...
<k>
<p>
I guess we just have to go
straight in from the entrance.
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
And then when we get to the
wall, we have to do
something...<wait 250> Yeah...<wait 250>something.
<k>  

stg8_las_42 <kanban>
Let fall the weakest...
<col 202060ff>
And That the Skies Lie...
</col>
Then build to the strongest...
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There's something written on
the wall.<wait 250> Based on that
message, I'd say...
<k>
<p>
We're supposed to defeat
these guys in order, from
weakest to strongest?
<k>
<p>
Uh...<wait 250> Well, I know the weakest
is the Dull Bones in the green
shoes there... <wait 250>That help?
<k>  

stg8_las_43 <kanban>
The shy one hides his shape...
<col 202060ff>
But the Stars Bring Balance.
</col>
The shy one hides his face...
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There's something written on
the wall.<wait 250> Based on that
message, I'd say...
<k>
<p>
That if we can be seen, then
there won't be anything to
see in this room?<wait 250> ...Huh?
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're inside the Palace of
Shadow.<wait 250> This seems to be a
corridor. <wait 250>I'm observant, huh?
<k>
<p>
Listen, Mario...<wait 250> I know I've said
this before, but don't forget
that you're not in this alone.
<k>
<p>
You should rely on your
partners' abilities if you ever
get stuck or anything.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
The gears in the back of this
room started moving when we
unlocked that planetarium...
<k>
<p>
Listen, Mario...
<k>
<p>
We're gonna have to rely on
everything we've learned to
get through this.
<k>
<p>
Just think about what we've
been through, and I'm sure
you'll find a way, OK?
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is another corridor.
<wait 250>
I wonder how long these
things go on?
<k>
<p>
I'm sure we'll need all of
your special skills, AND
those of your partners.
<k>
<p>
Don't forget to use your
strongest muscle, too...
<wait 250>
Your noggin! <wait 250>Hee hee!
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're inside the Palace of
Shadow.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> This place is all
about kooky puzzles, huh?
<k>
<p>
You see those ☆ marks in
the middle of the corridor?
<wait 250>
They've GOTTA be important.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're inside of the Palace of
Shadow.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> This is another
corridor. <wait 250>Big surprise.
<k>
<p>
We'd better watch below our
feet as well as above our
heads, know what I mean?
<k>
<p>
But, uh, don't forget the
area above your head, too!
<wait 300>
Does that make any sense?
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're inside the Palace of
Shadow.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> We must be WAY
underground by now.
<k>
<p>
I'm totally running out of
advice at this point, sorry.
<wait 250>
I have advisor's block.
<k>
<p>
Hey, but don't worry!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Have faith in yourself and
your friends, and we'll win!
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're inside the Palace of
Shadow.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> There don't seem to
be any big puzzles here.
<k>
<p>
We just need to go open that
door on the right.<wait 300> That's all.
<wait 250>
Whee. <wait 250>Exciting.
<k>  

stg8_las_44 <boss>
Who are you?!?
<k> stg8_las_45 <boss>
No one's disturbed me here
in aeons!
<k>
<p>
Who dares defile this sacred
place?!?
<k> stg8_las_46_kur Hey! <wait 250>Isn't that Hooktail?
<wait 250>
We totally beat it before!
<k>
<p>
What's it doing back?
<k> stg8_las_46_nok Ummm... <wait 250>Isn't that Hooktail?
<wait 250>
I KNOW we beat it before.
<wait 250>
It coughed up my dad!
<k>
<p>
What's it doing back?
<k> stg8_las_46_win My, what a fearsome dragon...
<wait 300>
But isn't this Hooktail, whom
you said you beat before?
<k>
<p>
Yes, big, with nasty eyes
and ripe breath...<wait 250> It sounds
just like what you described.
<k> stg8_las_46_yos Whoa!<wait 250> Now, THAT'S a dragon!
<wait 300>
Hey, but isn't that Hooktail?
<wait 250>
I thought you beat it!
<k>
<p>
Yeah, huge, dragonish,
gnarly...<wait 250> Sounds just like what
you described, dude!
<k> stg8_las_46_viv Uh... <wait 250>That's a big dragon.
<wait 300>
But, Mario, isn't that Hooktail,
the one you said you beat?
<k>
<p>
Gigantic, with mossy teeth...
<wait 250>
Yes, this monster fits the
bill, all right!
<k> stg8_las_46_bom Now who's this dragon fellow?
<wait 300>
I say, isn't that Hooktail,
the thing you beat before?
<k>
<p>
Yes, enormous, with rather
grimy toes...<wait 250> Yes, that suits
this fellow to a T!
<k> stg8_las_46_chu Isn't that Hooktail, dearie?
<wait 250>
I thought you beat Hooktail...

My first fresh meat in ages...

GWAAAAH HA HA HA HA!
<wait 250>
You are tough meat, my little
tasty morsels!

<p>
But how will you fare
against THIS!!!
<k> stg8_las_49_04 <boss>
Gwuhhh...
<k>
<p>
You are not the easy prey
you appear to be...
<k>
<p>
I would never be able to show
my face again if I was bested
by you whelps...

Can I...<wait 250>expire?

truly awakened?

<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Gloomtail's room.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I wonder if he was here for
all 1,000 years?
<k>
<p>
Dragons do live a long time,
I heard, but dang...
<k>
<p>
Without him in it, there
doesn't seem to be anything
special about the room.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
What is THIS weird room?
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
It's quiet... <wait 250>A little TOO...
<wait 400>
Well, let's just say it's quiet.
<k>
<p>
There's a Save Block over
there, and I'm thinking it
would be smart to use it.
<k>  

stg8_las_50_kur Jeepers... <wait 250>This room gives me
a super-bad feeling, Mario...
<wait 250>
What IS this chamber?
<k> stg8_las_50_nok Ummm... <wait 250>This room gives me
the willies, big-time.
<wait 250>
What IS this chamber?
<k> stg8_las_50_win Oh, my... <wait 250>This room makes me
feel simply awful, sugar.

<k> stg8_las_50_yos Ugh... <wait 250>This room creeps me
out, man.<wait 250> It's just...<wait 250>wrong.
<wait 250>

<k> stg8_las_50_viv This room makes me feel...<wait 250>bad.
<wait 250>
...But it seems familiar.

What IS this chamber?
<k> stg8_las_50_bom This room gives me a rather
foul feeling in my belly...
<wait 250>
What IS this chamber?
<k> stg8_las_50_chu This room gives me a very
bad feeling, dearie.
<wait 250>
What IS this chamber?
<k> stg8_las_51 Gaaack ack ack ack ack!
<k> stg8_las_52 We finally meet, Mario.
<k> stg8_las_53 I've been looking forward
to this, I must admit.
<k> stg8_las_54_kur So, this chump is the leader
of those X-Nauts?
<k> stg8_las_54_nok So, this guy is the leader
of those X-Nauts?
<k> stg8_las_54_win So, this gentleman is the
leader of those X-Nauts?
<k> stg8_las_54_yos So, this loser is the leader
of those X-Nauts?
<k> stg8_las_54_viv Gro... <wait 250>Grodus...
<k> stg8_las_54_bom So, this lout is the leader
of those X-Nauts?
<k> stg8_las_54_chu So, this fellow is the leader
of those X-Nauts?
<k> stg8_las_55 Yes...<wait 250>correct!!!
<k>
<p>
I am the supreme leader of
the secret society of
X-Nauts! <wait 250>I am Grodus!
<k>
<p>
But I'm getting ahead of
myself. <wait 250>I really must express
my thanks to you first...
<k> stg8_las_56 And do you know why?
<k>
<p>
You have gathered together
all of the Crystal Stars I
was seeking.
<k> stg8_las_57_kur No!<wait 250> So the last Crystal Star
we found on the moon...
<wait 250>
What did we do?
<k> stg8_las_57_nok No!<wait 250> So the last Crystal Star
we found on the moon...
<wait 250>
They wanted us to get it!
<k> stg8_las_57_win No!<wait 250> So the last Crystal Star
we found on the moon...
<wait 250>
What have we done?
<k> stg8_las_57_yos No!<wait 250> So the last Crystal Star
we found on the moon...
<wait 250>
We're IDIOTS!
<k> stg8_las_57_viv No!<wait 250> So the last Crystal Star
we found on the moon...
<wait 250>
We've played into their hand!
<k> stg8_las_57_bom No!<wait 250> So the last Crystal Star
we found on the moon...
<wait 250>
We're fools!
<k> stg8_las_57_chu No!<wait 250> So the last Crystal Star
we found on the moon...
<wait 250>
We were so blind!
<k> stg8_las_58 Gaaaack ack ack ack ack!
<wait 250>
You just realize now, do you?
<k>
<p>
Yes, instead of taking the
few Crystal Stars you fools
had bumbled into...
<k>
<p>
It was far easier to let you
find them all and open the
Thousand-Year Door for me...
<k>
<p>
How kind of you to bring
them all here to me!
<k>
<p>
All I had to do was entrust
the last Crystal Star to my
least competent underling! 
<k>
<p>
I don't suppose Crump had
any idea of my plan, though!
<wait 250>
Gaaack ack ack ack ack!
<k>
<p>
So, whether he beat you or
lost to you...
<k>
<p>
The Crystal Stars would be
together and mine either
way! <wait 250>Pure genius!
<k>
 stg8_las_60 Now, <wait 100>I thought the Shadow
Sirens would do a little
more to slow your progress...
<k>
<p>
But it appears they are so
useless that even this small
task was beyond them...
<k>
<p>
No matter... <wait 250>Now I get the
pleasure of sending you
to oblivion!
<k> stg8_las_61_kur Be careful, Mario!
<wait 250>
This jerk looks totally nasty!
<k> stg8_las_61_nok Watch yourself, Mario!
<wait 250>
This guy looks pretty tough!
<k> stg8_las_61_win Do be careful, dear!
<wait 250>
This fellow looks like he
means business!
<k> stg8_las_61_yos Watch it, Gonzales!
<wait 250>
This dude looks serious!
<k> stg8_las_61_viv Be careful, Mario!
<k> stg8_las_61_bom Watch your back, old boy!
<wait 250>
This burly fellow looks
rather robust!
<k> stg8_las_61_chu Be careful, dearie!
<wait 250>
He looks tough!
<k> stg8_las_62 Once you fools are gone,
no one will stand in my way!
<k>
<p>
Grodus will rule the world!
<k> stg8_las_63_kur No WAY we let that happen!
<k> stg8_las_63_nok We'll never let that happen!
<k> stg8_las_63_win We shan't let that happen!
<k> stg8_las_63_yos Not gonna happen, pal!
<k> stg8_las_63_viv We won't let that happen!
<k> stg8_las_63_bom We will NOT let that happen!
<k> stg8_las_63_chu We'll never let that happen!
<k> stg8_las_64 Now, come!
<k> stg8_las_65 Meet your ends, you
meddlesome fools!
<k>
<p>
You will know my power!
<k> stg8_las_66 So, you have the mettle to
push me this far...
<k>
<p>
But no more!
<k> stg8_las_67 Argh!<wait 250> You will not stop me!
<k>
<p>
Take THIS!
<k> stg8_las_68 Guhhh...<wait 250> Fools!
<k> stg8_las_69 Unhh... <wait 250>No...
<k> stg8_las_70 Uuuuuuunhh...
<wait 250>
You are more than you seem...
<k>
<p>
But this is not finished.
<wait 250>
I saw even this possibility.
<k> stg8_las_71_kur Huh?
<k> stg8_las_71_nok What?
<k> stg8_las_71_win Excuse me?
<k> stg8_las_71_yos Whuh?
<k> stg8_las_71_viv Hmm?
<k> stg8_las_71_bom Pardon?
<k> stg8_las_71_chu Mm?

stg7_moo_03_kur Wow! <wait 250>That was KILLER!
<k>
<p>
I totally never would've
guessed I'd get to do THAT!
<k> stg7_moo_03_nok Man! <wait 250>That was something!
<k>
<p>
Who would've thought I'd ever
get to do THAT?
<k> stg7_moo_03_win My! <wait 250>That was exciting!
<k>
<p>
I'd never DREAMED I'd do a
thing like THAT!
<k> stg7_moo_03_yos Whoa!<wait 250> That was AWESOME!
<k>
<p>
Man, who knew adventurers
got to do stuff like THAT!
<k> stg7_moo_03_viv Gee whiz!<wait 250> That was wild!
<k>
<p>
I never thought I'd take a
ride like THAT...
<k> stg7_moo_03_bom Harumph! Well, that was
rather a bumpy trip, wot wot!
<k>
<p>
Who would've guessed I'd
get to do such a thing...
<k> stg7_moo_03_chu Oh, my! <wait 250>That was quite fun!
<k>
<p>
I can't say I ever thought
I'd take a ride like THAT!
<k> stg7_moo_04_kur Well, so, yeah, here we are!
<wait 250>
We're totally on the moon!
<k>
<p>
So let's get going, Mario!
<wait 250>
Let's find the last Crystal
Star and save the princess!
<k> stg7_moo_04_nok Well, we're really on the
moon, all right!
<k>
<p>
So, are you ready, Mario?
<wait 250>
Let's find the last Crystal
Star and save the princess!
<k> stg7_moo_04_win Well, here we are, darling!
<wait 250>
The moon!
<k>
<p>
So, dear...<wait 250>let's move, hmm?
<wait 250>
Let's find the last Crystal
Star and save Peach!
<k> stg7_moo_04_yos Whoa! We're really, truly,
no-fooling on the moon!
<k>
<p>
Let's rock out, Gonzales!
<wait 250>
Let's find the last Crystal
Star and save Peach!
<k> stg7_moo_04_viv Well, we're really on the
moon, all right!
<k>
<p>
Are you ready, Mario?
<wait 250>
Let's find the last Crystal
Star and save Peach!
<k> stg7_moo_04_bom Well, old boy, we're really
on the moon, by Crabbery!
<k>
<p>
So, what say you?<wait 250> Shall we
find the last Crystal Star
and save Peach, hmm?
<k> stg7_moo_04_chu Well, here we are, on the
moon, dearie!
<k>
<p>
Are you ready?<wait 250> Then let's
find the last Crystal Star
and save Peach!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're on the moon! <wait 250>Awesome!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
The moon I always look up
at, can you believe it?
<k>
<p>
I mean, I heard they'd put a
Goomba on the moon in '69,
but who knew WE'D get here?
<k>
<p>
Boy, nothing's impossible on
your adventures, Mario!
<wait 250>
You are the COOLEST!
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
Boy, I guess there are pretty
much just rocks on the moon.
<k>
<p>
I guess I knew that, but it's
still kind of disappointing.
<k>
<p>
<wait 300><scale 0.67>
Bummer...
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
There's a weird-looking
building off in the distance.
<wait 300>
Why would THAT be here?
<k>
<p>
Looks like we'll need to find
a pipe to get there, though.
<wait 300>
So...<wait 250>let's look for a pipe.
<k>  

stg7_moo_01_kur EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEK!
<wait 750> stg7_moo_01_nok WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
<wait 750> stg7_moo_01_win EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
<wait 750> stg7_moo_01_yos WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOAAAA!
<wait 750> stg7_moo_01_viv WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!
<wait 750> stg7_moo_01_bom YAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH!
<wait 750> stg7_moo_01_chu AAAAAIIIIIIIIIIIII!
<wait 750>  

stg7_aji_63 <tec>
Peach...
<k>
<p>
Good-bye...
<k> ep_45 <housou>
Speaking of miracle survivals...
Guess whose favorite
calculator is still computing?
<k>
<p>
He says he really wants to
see you and Peach again!
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
The stars sure are pretty
here.<wait 300> I wonder if I can find
my favorite constellation...
<k>
<p>
I'm such a totally shameless
romantic, it's not even funny.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
You see the Moon Clefts that
live up here?
<k>
<p>
You think they live on green
cheese, Mario?
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
...You know I'm kidding, right?
<wait 300>
I'm not that much of a
cheeseball...<wait 250>get it?
<k>
<p>
<dkey><wait 300></dkey><scale 0.67>
I'm still bummed there are only rocks here.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
Hey, Mario!<wait 250> Did you see that?
<wait 300>
I saw a comet or something!
<wait 300>
It was all, like, "PSHOOWEE!"
<k>
<p>
Should I try and make three
wishes, do you think?
<k>
<p>
I wish for...<wait 300> Hee hee hee!
<wait 250>
That's <wait 100>TOP<wait 100> SEC<wait 100>RET!
<k>  

stg2_mri_e03_00 ...Uh...
<k> stg2_mri_e03_01_kur What's going on?
<k> stg2_mri_e03_01_nok Oh, no...<wait 100> What's the matter?
<k> stg2_mri_e03_02 Uh, well...<wait 100> Take a look!
<wait 250>
This door wasn't here before!<wait 250>

Someone just installed it!
<k>
<p>
And...<wait 100>I can't open it.
<wait 500>
I thought I could finally
save everyone...<wait 250> I'm a fool.
<k> stg2_mri_e03_03_kur Oh, quit being melodramatic!<wait 250> 
Although...<wait 100>it does look thick.
<wait 500>
What are we gonna do now?
<k> stg2_mri_e03_03_nok Hey, don't take it so hard...<wait 250> 
It does look sturdy, though.
<wait 500>
What do we do now?
<k> stg2_mri_e03_04 ................Uh................
<k>
<p>
................Um................
................Hmmmm.............
<k>
<p>
................Ermmm.............
.............Mmmmmmmm.............
.......Hrrrmmmmmmmmmmmm...........
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>
GOT IT!
</dynamic>
<k> stg2_mri_e03_06 Long ago, the Puni elder told
me about a secret entrance
somewhere around here.
<k>
<p>
We can get in through there!
<wait 250>
I'm completely sure of it!
<wait 250>
Uh, problem is...
<k>
<p>
I doubt finding it is going
to be easy.<wait 250> I mean, it won't
be labeled "Secret Entrance"!
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
What should we do?
<k> stg2_mri_e03_07_kur How are we supposed to find
a secret entrance?<wait 250> It's
secret for a reason, y'know.
<k> stg2_mri_e03_07_nok Not to be a worrywart, but
how in the heck can we find
somebody's secret entrance?
<k> stg2_mri_e03_08 Well, it's hidden by this
invisible...<wait 100>thingy.<wait 250> We need to
find and remove the thingy.
<k>
<p>
Boy, but removing a normal
thingy sounds tough enough,
let alone an invisible one!
<k>
<p>
<dkey><wait 250>Uh.<wait 250>.<wait 250>.<wait 500></dkey> 
<p>
Oh! <wait 100>Got it!<wait 100> Flurrie!
<k>
<p>
Surely Madame Flurrie's
powers can help us!
<k> stg2_mri_e03_09 Flurrie is a refined and
dignified lady who lives
in these woods.
<k>
<p>
The elder says she's a wind
spirit who can wield the
powers of the air with ease.
<k>
<p>
You see where I'm going with
this?<wait 100> She can use wind power
to blow the thingy away!
<k>
<p>
Well, it won't hurt to try.<wait 250> 
Flurrie lives in the deepest
corner of the woods, so...
<k>
<p>
Let's head back in the
direction we came from.
<k> stg2_mri_e10_00 That's the secret entrance!
<wait 250>
We can finally get inside!<wait 250> 
Here I goooooooo!
<k> stg2_mri_e10_01 Aren't Punies just the most
precious little things?
<k> stg2_mri_e10_01_01 Mario, I feel I must ask...
<wait 250>
Did you know that I used to
be a rather famous actress?
<k>
<p>
I was a diva of the stage!<wait 250> 
I was known as Madame
Flurrie the world over...
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 100>the filthy air outside
the spotlight repelled me.
<wait 250>
So I came to the woods.
<k> stg2_mri_e10_01_02 And soon enough, I glimpsed
the beauty of these Punies
and their pure little hearts...
<k>
<p>
It reminded me of my own
innocence as an actress.
<wait 250>
And that made me realize...
<k>
<p>
I shall ever love the stage!
<wait 250>
I must feel the spotlight
shine on me again! <wait 100>I MUST!
<k>
<p>
As you can see, these dear
little Punies helped me find
my true self...
<k>
<p>
That's why I must help them
however I can before I go
on my own adventures.
<k> stg2_mri_e10_02 Mario! <wait 250>Can you hear me?
<k> stg2_mri_e10_03 Check it out!<wait 250> I was able to
open it from the inside!
<wait 250>
C'mon! <wait 100>Over here!
<k> stg2_mri_e10_04 The time has come for me to
repay my debt to the Punies.
<wait 250>
Come along, Mario!
<k> stg2_mri_e10_05 Hurry up! <wait 100>Go inside!
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_01 Uh... <wait 100>Thank you, Mario, for
everything you've done.
<k>
<p>
We can go back to our
peaceful way of life now.
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_02 You know, son, now that we
get right down to it, I'm
kind of sad to see you go.
<k>
<p>
I do love pontificating,
so come on by whenever you
want to sit and chat awhile.
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_03 Yes, please come back and
visit! <wait 100>We'll watch for you!
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_04 We'll work together from now
on to prevent anything like
that from happening again.
<k>
<p>
Thanks for showing us how to
stick together, Mario.<wait 100> Good
luck with the Crystal Stars.
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_05_kur Oh, I'm sure we'll be back
again at some point. <wait 250>Yeah,
definitely!<wait 100> Take care, guys!
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_05_nok We'll come back and see you
again, I'm pretty sure. <wait 250>But...<wait 100> 
For now, we gotta go.
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_05_win Oh, this shan't be our last
visit. <wait 100>Certainly not!<wait 250> But...<wait 100> 
Until then, ta-ta!
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_06 See you, Mr. Mario!
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_07 We'll be all right, Mario.<wait 250> 
Good luck with your search
for the Crystal Stars.
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_08 I can't wait to see you
again, Mr. Mario!
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_09 Take care, big 'stache man!
<k> stg2_mri_e26_00_10 I'll be happy to pontificate
for you anytime you like.

too! <wait 250>...Hey!<wait 100> Where's the
elevator, huh?
<k> irai_28_006 So, this is the Great Tree...
<k>
<p>
How much history has this
grand tree witnessed in its
many long years?
<k>
<p>
And how many more amazing
events will it witness in the
coming years?<wait 250> Indeed...
<k>
<p>
So beautiful...<wait 250> This tree, that
has surpassed the lives of
many creatures... <wait 250>Scary...
<k> irai_28_006_1 Ah, the Great Tree...
<k>
<p>
As you watch us foolishly
continue to repeat history...
<wait 250>
What could you think of us?
<k>
<p>
You can do nothing but stand
and watch our ignorance.
<wait 250>
No!<wait 100> What rot!
<k>
<p>
To assume that a tree can
do nothing!<wait 250> That only proves
my own foolishness!
<k> stg8_dark_02 ...B-Brother?
<k> stg8_dark_02_01 The...sky...<wait 250> It's...
<k> stg8_las_148_10 Whoa!<wait 250> The Crystal Star!!!

Yes, a mystery that...

That's what the Crystal Star
is here to tell us! <wait 250>I just
KNOW it!
<k> stg8_las_148_14 What?<wait 250> Could it be...
<k>
<p>
...Hey, you're right, Petuni!
<k>
<p>
I can hear...<wait 250> I can hear it!
<wait 250>
The Crystal Star is speaking
to us!
<k>
<p>
It's telling us that Mario is
fighting to save the world!
<wait 250>
And he's in deep trouble...
<k> stg8_las_148_15 Mario!<wait 250> Flurrie! <wait 250>C'mon!
<wait 250>
Don't give up!

if we found Mario. <wait 100>Remember?

those guys, Mario.<wait 250> Seriously,
way to go!
<k>
<p>
But the question remains...<wait 100> 
Where did everybody go?
<k>
<p>
What could possibly make
everyone leave?
<k> stg2_mri_e12_01 Finally, SOMEBODY shows up!<wait 250>

while you were gone!
<k> stg2_mri_e12_17 What?<wait 250> What are you talking
about, Puniper?
<k> stg2_mri_e12_17_02 ...And why are there so few
of you here, anyway?
<wait 250>
What happened to everyone?
<k> stg2_mri_e12_18 Well, they've been captured...
<wait 400>
by those goons!
<k>
<p>
The elder...<wait 250> Everybody...
<wait 250>
Including...
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>
Your sister!

<k> stg2_mri_e12_19 <dynamic 3>
WHAT?!?<wait 100> PETUNI?!?
</dynamic>
<wait 250>
Tell me it isn't so!
<k> stg2_mri_e12_20 Oh, it's so, all right!
<wait 250>
She was taken off somewhere
with the rest of them!
<k>
<p>
They said it was because we
wouldn't tell them where to
find some crystal thing.
<k>
<p>
We told them we'd never
heard of it.
<k> stg2_mri_e12_21 Oh, poor Petuni...
<k>
<p>
Well, that absolutely tears it!
<wait 250>
We've all got to go look for
them right away!
<k> stg2_mri_e12_22 What are you saying, Punio?
<wait 250>
We can't do anything to
those giant goons!
<k>
<p>
Besides, they aren't alone.
<wait 250>
The cursed Jabbi tribe is
in league with them.
<k>
<p>
They're hoping to make this
tree their own once we've all
been driven from it.
<k>
<p>
This is it for us.<wait 100> The end!
<wait 250>
And adding this hairy old man
to our ranks won't help a bit!
<k> stg2_mri_e12_23 How can you say that?
<wait 250>
You can't know that! <wait 100>We
HAVE to try, don't you see?
<k>
<p>
Think about it!<wait 100> If we all get
together we can take care
of any stupid Jabbies!
<k>
<p>
So, who's with me, huh?
<wait 250>
Come on, everyone! <wait 100>Let's pool
our strength!
<k> stg2_mri_e12_24 Hah!<wait 250> Punio, Punio, Punio...
<wait 250>
You'll have to convince me,
because I think you're nuts.
<k>
 stg2_mri_e12_24_00 What's that supposed to
mean?
<k> stg2_mri_e12_24_01 Tell you what:<wait 100> you and
Mr. Mustache there can get
the revolution started!
<k>
<p>
If you can free our friends
who got locked up somewhere
in the tree...
<k>
<p>
...then I'll join your little
crusade. <wait 100>Hah!<wait 100> Like that'll
ever happen! <wait 100>Please!
<k> stg2_mri_e12_25 Fine! <wait 100>We'll show you!
<k>
<p>
Right, Mario?<wait 100> Right?
<wait 250>
C'mon, follow me to glory!
<wait 250>
Let's go help them!
<k> stg2_mri_e12_26 Hah! <wait 100>I say again:<wait 100> hah!
<wait 250>
By all means, help our friends!
<k>
<p>
Or are you quitting now...<wait 250> 
Telling me there's no hope...
<wait 250>
That it's impossible?
<k> stg2_mri_e15_00 Well, if it isn't Punio...
<k>
<p>
Hmph! <wait 100>You heard me!<wait 100> Hmph!
<wait 250>
I can't say I expected you to
manage to rescue the elder...
<k> stg2_mri_e15_01 I told you I could do it!
<k> stg2_mri_e15_02 Don't get a swelled head!
<wait 250>
This doesn't mean I'll
accept you as our leader...
<k>
<p>
And it definitely doesn't
mean I completely trust
that mustache guy, either.
<k>
<p>
For starters, you still
haven't rescued the other
Punies yet.
<k>
<p>
I'm not lifting an antenna
to help until you do.

We must stand together now!
<wait 100>
We must take back our tree!
<dynamic 3>
Don't you understand that?
</dynamic>
<k> stg2_mri_e15_04 But... <wait 100>But, Elder...
<k> stg2_mri_e15_05 Shut your trap, Puniper!<wait 250> 
And mind me, you hear?
<wait 250>
You'll help Mustachio here...
<k>
<p>
What'd you say your name
was again? <wait 100>It was, er...
<wait 250>
It was Marty, wasn't it?
<k> stg2_mri_e15_06 It's "Mario"! <wait 100>He's Mario!
<wait 250>
I mean, sheesh!<wait 100> He's only
world-famous! <wait 100>Come on!
<k> stg2_mri_e15_07 Yes, yes, simmer down, you.<wait 250> 
And everyone else, help
Marty-o clear out our tree!
<k> stg2_mri_e15_08 Oh, all right, Elder...
<wait 250>
Whatever you say.
<k>
<p>
I'm not heartless or anything.<wait 250> 
To tell you the truth, I'm
worried about Petuni, too.
<k>
<p>
And you're right, we have no
choice. <wait 100>We must fight!
<wait 250>
Right, everybody?
<k> stg2_mri_e15_09 There you go, my Punies!
<wait 250>
That's the spirit!

<k> stg2_mri_e15_12 Thanks, you guys...
<k> stg2_mri_e15_13_kur Hey, if you're done rallying
everyone... <wait 100>I have a question.
<k>
<p>
We're looking for this Crystal
Star thingamajig...
<wait 250>
Ever heard of it?
<k> stg2_mri_e15_13_nok Umm, while we have your
attention, can I ask you
something?
<k>
<p>
We're looking for this thing
called a Crystal Star...
<wait 250>
Have you heard of it?
<k> stg2_mri_e15_13_win Say, if you have a moment...<wait 100> 
Might I ask a question?
<k>
<p>
We're looking for a lovely
gem called a Crystal Star...
<wait 250>
Do you know of it?
<k> stg2_mri_e15_14 The Crystal Star, eh?
<k>
<p>
Hrrrrrmmmmmmm...
<wait 400>
Yes, perhaps...
<wait 400>
<k>
<p>
Hidden down, down, down at
the bottom of this tree is
a funny-colored stone.
<k>
<p>
But what do we do with it?<wait 250> 
Oh, right:<wait 100> "Guard it from evil
and give it to a pure heart..."
<k>
<p>
That's what generations of
elders have been taught.
<wait 250>
Might be the Crystal Star...
<k> stg2_mri_e15_15 Marty! <wait 250>Or...<wait 100>Marty-o!
<wait 250>
I'm thinking you better get
it before those goons do.
<k>
<p>
I don't quite see how just
yet, but I bet it's connected
to us getting our tree back.
<k>
<p>
You got all that, Marty-o?
<wait 250>
Crystal Star.<wait 100> Bottom part
of the tree. <wait 100>Go to it.
<k> stg2_mri_e15_16 Oh! <wait 100>Hold your horses!
<wait 250>
I forgot something!
<k>
<p>
Before you can get the
Crystal Star, you must save
all of the captured Punies.
<k>
<p>
Yup, you'll never get to that
gem without the help of the
Punies. <wait 250>Not a chance.
<k>
<p>
So here, you'd better take
this.<wait 250> It's the Puni Orb.
<wait 250>
It's the symbol of our leader.
<k> stg2_mri_e15_16_01 If you place this in the
pedestals you see around the
tree, the Punies will gather.
<k>
<p>
Just remember to take the
orb with you when you're
done using it.
<k>
<p>
Because, well, if you don't,
everyone'll just kind of hang
out and stare at the orb.
<k> stg2_mri_e15_18 All right, guys!<wait 250> Let's go
rescue everybody!
<k> stg2_mri_e15_19 Oh, and one more thing...
<k> stg2_mri_e15_20 So sorry!<wait 100> So sorry!
<wait 250>
I've been awfully forgetful
as of late.
<k> stg2_mri_e15_21 Now then, where was I?
<wait 250>
Oh, right! <wait 100>On your way to
the Crystal Star...
<k>
<p>
If you lose any of the Punies
and have a hard time finding
them, just come see me.
<k>
<p>
What I'll do is, I'll give a
<dynamic 3>whistle</dynamic> to call 'em back here.
<wait 250>
You got all that?
<k> stg2_mri_e15_22 Hey! <wait 100>What's the matter?

Hrmm? <wait 100>What?<wait 100> What is it?
<wait 250>
I don't think there are any
lost Punies out there.
<k>
<p>
Are you sure you aren't a
little crazy in the head?<wait 250> 
Do you hear any voices?
<k> stg2_mri_e15_27 <p>
Eh? <wait 100>What's that you say?
<wait 250>
Everyone's trapped in some
cell somewhere? <wait 250>Egads!
<k>
<p>
Well, if that's the case, my
calling them certainly isn't
going to get them out.
<k>
<p>
You need to get moving and
get them out of there now!<wait 250> 
C'mon!<wait 100> Lickety-split!
<k> stg2_mri_e15_28 <p>
Are you ready, Marty-o?
<wait 250>
The Crystal Star is at the
very bottom of the tree.
<k>
<p>
For the sake of the Puni
tribe's future, you mustn't
give in to those thugs.
<k> stg2_mri_e15_29 <p>
Well! <wait 100>I'm shocked!
<wait 250>
Who makes fun of an old
woman like that!<wait 100> Honestly!
<k>
<p>
Why, if I were just ten years
younger, I'd show you! <wait 100>Oh,
you'd best believe it!
<k>
<p>
I'll have you know that in
my younger days I was
considered a Puni prize!
<k>
<p>
I had so many suitors, I
had to fight them off! 
<wait 250>
Eeeh hee hee hee hee hee!
<k>
<p>
Now that I think about it,
there was a particularly
fine boy named Punderton...
<k> stg2_mri_e15_30 <system>

Two hours later...
<k> stg2_mri_e15_31 ...And that's how I became
the Puni elder, the leader
of the Puni tribe.

I know yours, so good luck

<k> kpa_stg3_021 That's right, you rude thing!<wait 250> 
We gave it to a mustachioed
man named Marty-o!

<p>
He said he was collecting
the legendary treasures to
rescue some princess...
<k>
<p>
What did he call her?<wait 250> 
Princess Pinch?<wait 300> Yep! <wait 250>He was
off to save that lucky lass!
<k> kpa_stg3_022 It's "MARIO"!<wait 250> Not "MARTY-O"!
<wait 300>
And it's not "Princess Pinch"!<wait 250> 
Her name is "Princess PEACH"!
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
...But your senility is beside
the point!<wait 250> The princess and
treasures must be connected!

Treasures, princesses...<wait 250>

Peach and the Crystal Stars
belong to me! <wait 250>To MEEEEE!!!

finish him off once and for

It's like another world
inside this tree, huh?!?
<k>
<p>
And check out these statues!
<wait 300>
They must've been left by
the ancestors of the Punies.
<k>
<p>
I wonder how many years the
Punies have lived in this
place, anyway...
<k>
<p>
These are the kinds of
questions archaeologists
have to ask, y'know.

That's Punio of the Punies.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He sure is a hardworking
little fella, huh?

Don't you just wanna cheer
him on?<wait 250> I always root for the
underdog.<wait 250> Or whatever he is.

He sure is big for a Puni.
<k>
<p>
Too bad his head is big, too!
<k> ƒvƒj‘°’·˜V <keyxon>
That's the Puni elder.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She's ancient, but actually
peppier than everyone else.

<p>
No need to worry about her!
<wait 300>
She'll live to be 150, griping
and nagging all the way...
<k> ƒKƒCƒh–… <keyxon>
That's Petuni of the Punies.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She's Punio's little sister.
<k>
<p>
I hope they can all live
peacefully together now,
don't you?
<k> ƒvƒj‘°‚P <keyxon>
Well, that's a Puni, all right...

<p>
Look, I'm totally sorry, Mario.
<wait 300>
Punio and those guys are the
only ones I can recognize!

That's a Puni...
<k>
<p>
You know what I wonder?
<wait 250>
Why are they called Punies?
<wait 300>
Because they're...<wait 250> Oh...<wait 250>right.

This is an interesting
pedestal, Mario.

<p>
When the Punies stand on
the panel, the machine
counts them and responds!

The ancient Punies must've
been really sophisticated...
<wait 300>
This is totally fascinating!

You're looking well.
<k> stg2_mri_e12_26_03 Why are you so calm, Elder?
<wait 250>
You're trapped! <wait 250>And this is
our daring rescue of you!

<wait 250>
Well, thanks, I suppose.<wait 250> 
Those are quite exciting.
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 100>I think you ought to
help the other Punies before
you rescue me.
<k> stg2_mri_e12_26_05 Where are the others?
<k> stg2_mri_e12_26_06 <small>

Where was I?
<wait 650>
<p>
Ah. Yes. Right.
<wait 650>
<p>
Your question.
<wait 650>

The rest of
the Punies...
<wait 650>

unfortunately,
are locked...

away in the

telling you...

those uncouth,

whatsoever...
<wait 650>
<p>
for the elderly!
<wait 650>
<p>
None! None,
I tell you!
<wait 650>

Honestly, I
have to ask...

what's a Puni

<p>
supposed to
do in a...

situation like
this. I ask you!
<wait 650>
<p>
Please, I
want to know.
<wait 650>

But anyway,
Punio, listen...
<wait 650>
<p>
Yes, listen
to your elder...
<wait 650>

I have to
say something...
<wait 650>

vital to you.
Listen up!

You never interrupt an elder
mid-lecture!<wait 100> NEVER!

<p>
You wonder why the other
Punies call you a "doofus"
sometimes?<wait 250> That's why.

<p>
And your time to be a doofus
is over, because you have to
lead our Puni tribe one day!

Yes, I understand.
<k> stg2_mri_e14_09 Bah!<wait 100> Only answer ONCE!

why are you here, anyway?

In that case, get me out of

You're that thieving girl we

<wait 250>
Are you a friend of Mario's?
<k>
<p>
Oh, wait... <wait 250>I see.<wait 250> And I most
certainly do NOT approve!
<k> stg2_mri_e13_02 Well, anyway, I heard there
were nice badges to be found
here, so I came looking...

Only problem is, I've been

We can jump this gap easily,
but I think the Punies will
totally plummet down there.
<k>
<p>
If you gather them into a
group and blow on them, they
should all fall over the edge...
<k>
<p>
But then they'll come back
up in bubbles! <wait 250>And then you
can blow them across!

As for the door on the left,

I wonder how long Punies live,
anyway...

I mean, generally, smaller
creatures don't live as long
as larger ones, but...

<p>
Hmm...<wait 250> Maybe we shouldn't
think too much about that...

stg2_mri_e17_03_02 Mario! <wait 100>Did you see it?
<wait 250>
That was a Jabbi!

<p>
Based on what Puniper said,
they're helping the intruders
and trying to seize the tree.
<k>
<p>
Our tribes have been enemies
for a long time now.<wait 250> Every
time we meet, we fight. <wait 250>A lot.

with Jabble. <wait 100>He's of the
Jabbi tribe...

I wonder if even Jabble is
my enemy now...
<k> stg2_mri_e17_03 Ouch! <wait 100>I can't believe we lost!
<wait 250>
We'll definitely beat them
next time, though, right?
<k> stg2_mri_e17_03_01 Maybe we're outnumbered...<wait 250> 
We may not be able to pull
this off...

How does it work, anyway?

<p>
I mean, it's just so squishy.<wait 250> 
Know what I mean?<wait 100> I can't
help it.<wait 100> It says "Squish me."

I'm trying to quench my urge

making a song about it.

You can't go there alone.

Well, if you must ask...

It's because when Jabbies
fight, they attack in one
huge clump. <wait 250>Duuuuh!

Different stores have

And that, bud, is all I got

We've come down pretty far.
<wait 250>
The air is a bit colder here,
don'tcha think?
<k>
<p>
The technology used here is
pretty insane, too.<wait 300> I wish I
had more time to inspect it.
<k>  

stg2_mri_e22_00 Hmm... <wait 100>Lemme see...
<wait 250>
That thing's gotta be around
here somewheres...
<k> stg2_mri_e22_01 Buh...<wait 100>huh?<wait 250> What's that?
<wait 250>
Whoa! <wait 100>Sounds like a mob!<wait 250> 
Better clear out...
<k> stg2_mri_e23_00_00_kur Wow, Mario! <wait 100>Check it out!
<wait 500>
The Crystal Star! <wait 100>Score!
<k> stg2_mri_e23_00_00_nok Mario, look!<wait 100> Look look look!
<wait 500>
It's the Crystal Star!
<k> stg2_mri_e23_00_00_win Oh, dear me!<wait 100> Mario!
<wait 500>
Isn't that the Crystal Star?
<k> stg2_mri_e23_00_kur Hey! <wait 100>You!<wait 100> I see you, jerk!
<wait 250>
Mario, it's that weasel!
<k> stg2_mri_e23_00_nok What?<wait 250> Did he just...<wait 100> Hey!
<wait 250>
What's going on here?
<k> stg2_mri_e23_00_win Oh, dear! <wait 100>That wretched
beast again! <wait 250>Dearie me!
<k> stg2_mri_e23_01 Buh! <wait 50>Buh!<wait 100> Buh huh huh!
<wait 250>
Man, am I lucky or what?<wait 250> 
Or am I just gooooood?
<k>
<p>
"Oh, you say you need a
Crystal Star, Lord Crump?"<wait 250> 
BOOM!<wait 100> Falls right in my lap!
<k> stg2_mri_e23_02 Still, this is humiliating!
<wait 250>
You shouldn't have been able
to escape that cell...
<k>
<p>
So, for insulting my awesome
trap, I'm gonna repay you
with a little present.
<k>
<p>
Know what it is?
<k> stg2_mri_e23_03 Oh, just a little something I
like to call A REMOTE
TIME-BOMB DETONATOR!
<k> stg2_mri_e23_04 I'm gonna use this to bury
you and those squirmy Punies
in rubble!<wait 250> Sound fun?
<k>
<p>
Well, enjoy your final minutes
inside this dank old tree!
<wait 250>
And with that...<wait 100>pow!<wait 100> I'm gone!
<k> stg2_mri_e23_05_kur This is so not cool!
<wait 250>
We gotta get out of here!<wait 100> 
Right now!
<k> stg2_mri_e23_05_nok D-Did he just say...
<wait 250>
Eek! <wait 100>H-Hurry!<wait 100> We have to get
the heck out of here!
<k> stg2_mri_e23_05_win I must say, I craved exciting
times, but I never expected
this!<wait 100> Let's go, quickly now!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This must be the lowest
chamber.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Saying it's solemn
here is an understatement.
<k>
<p>
Under these statues' glares...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I feel like the Punies'
ancestors are watching us...
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This door was made by Crump
and his cronies.<wait 300> It doesn't
match the decor at all.
<k>
<p>
As for the door, if you use
the panel there, it should
unlock the whole thing.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This area makes me feel like
I'm exploring a watery swamp
even though we're in a tree...
<k>
<p>
Water! <wait 250>I bet we need Koops!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
...Um...<wait 300> Or maybe that doesn't
make any sense at all...
<k>  

stg2_mri_e18_00_01 Uhhhhh...<wait 100>huh? <wait 100>What?<wait 250> 
What just happened?
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_02 Buh! <wait 50>Buh!<wait 100> Buh huh huh!
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_03 Man, you guys are dense!
<wait 250>
Brilliant little trap, huh?<wait 250> 
And BOY, did you bite on it!
<k>
<p>
I saw you sticking that silly
stone on the pedestals, so I
made a fake one...<wait 250> Awesome.
<k>
<p>
I mean, I KNEW it was great,
but seeing you fall for it
really gives me a warm fuzzy.
<k>
<p>
Buh! <wait 50>Buh!<wait 100> Buh huh huh!<wait 250> Talk
about complete idiots!<wait 250> You
guys are so dumb, it hurts!
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_04 Anyway, with you fools out of
the picture, I can take my
time hunting the Crystal Star.
<k>
<p>
Buh! <wait 50>Buh!<wait 100> Buh huh huh!
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_05 Mario!<wait 100> What do we do?
<k>
<p>
Uh... <wait 100>We HAVE to find a way
out of here...
<k>
<p>
But what can we do?
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_06 THINK, Punio! <wait 100>There has to
be a way out of here!
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_07 Big brother, I'm scared...
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_08 Hmph! <wait 50>You heard me!<wait 100> Hmph!
<wait 250>
Unbelievable. <wait 100>You got fooled
by a painfully obvious trap...
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_09_kur This isn't good, Mario.<wait 250> 
We gotta do something.
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_09_nok Boy! <wait 100>This just isn't right.<wait 100> 
Let's do something before
my claustrophobia sets in...
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_09_win My!<wait 100> Such wonderful drama!<wait 100> 
I imagine we have to do
something now, don't we?
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_12 Mario! <wait 100>Think of something!
<wait 250>
I'm counting on you!
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_11_kur Hey! <wait 100>Check these out!
<wait 250>
I SWEAR I've seen these
decorated columns before...
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_11_nok Wait... <wait 100>You see those?
<wait 250>
I'm pretty sure I've seen
columns like those before...
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_11_win Pardon me a moment!
<wait 250>
Don't these odd columns look
somewhat familiar?
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_10_kur Huh?<wait 100> Did you feel that?
<wait 250>
That crazy shaking? 
What in the world was that?
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_10_nok Huh? <wait 100>Whoa, whoa, whoa!
<wait 250>
The... <wait 100>The tree just shook!<wait 250> 
What was it? <wait 100>An earthquake?
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_10_win Oh, I feel I might swoon!
<wait 250>
What was that, I wonder?
<k> stg2_mri_e18_00_13 You did it!<wait 100> Yes!<wait 50> Yes!
<wait 250>
Now we can get out of here!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
The structure of this tree
is pretty complicated...
<k>
<p>
Looks like we're only gonna
move on with the help of
the Punies, huh?
<k>
<p>
We're gonna seriously need
to use our thinking caps as
we go forward...
<k> ガイド <keyxon>
If you look closely, Punio
is actually different from
the other Punies.
<k>
<p>
First of all, his dealy-bopper
is green...<wait 300> His coat's different
too...<wait 300> Did you notice?
<k> ガイド妹 <keyxon>
That's Petuni, Punio's sister.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She really trusts her brother.
<k>
<p>
Let's hurry up and get her
out of here.<wait 300> Oh, and all of
the others, too.
<k> ライバル <keyxon>
That's Puniper of the Punies.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's a little bigger than the
others, obviously.
<k>
<p>
So maybe he can help us
reach that special area...
<wait 250>
Hee hee! <wait 100>Just kidding.
<k>
<p>
His only special power is
complaining, I think.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're inside the Great Tree.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Grasses and other plants
grow in here.<wait 250> Isn't that cool?
<k>
<p>
You think the Great Tree
is like a...<wait 250>host organism?
<wait 300>
Biology is just SO cool...
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
The Punies are totally afraid
of these Piders.
<k>
<p>
When a Pider drops, the
Punies completely lose it and
bolt in every direction.
<k>
<p>
You're gonna have to defeat
any Piders near the path you
wanna lead the Punies along.
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're inside the Great Tree.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Looks like lots of tufts of
vegetation around here.
<k>
<p>
Stuff could be hidden in
those things, so let's make
sure to check each one, OK?

<wait 250>
Fortune from disaster:<wait 250> the
kindly sea washed us ashore.
<k>
<p>
What strange irony that this
island was our intended
destination all along, no?
<k>
<p>
And yet, we mourn. <wait 250>We have
lost three crew members,
including Admiral Bobbery.
<k>
<p>
It pains me to think they
were taken by the pirate
king, that ghostly thing...
<k>
<p>
What happens to us now, ah?
<wait 250>
We may be lost without hope,
stricken in the wilds...

Month ☆ Day ×♥
<wait 250>
We have made a semblance
of civilized life here.
<k>
<p>
The ship's flotsam washed in,
<wait 250>
and we now have salty bread
and other salty things...

<p>
We can live for some time on
this salty bounty of the sea...
<wait 250>
But then what, I ask?
<k> stg5_muj_02 <diary>
Month ☆ Day ○○
<wait 250>
We have built a few huts
from the washed-up timbers...
<k>
<p>
Ah, poor, sweet S.S. Flavion!
<wait 250>
At least the shanties keep
out the wind and rain.
<k>
<p>
We still have had no sign of
Bobbery and the others, and
my heart, she doubts...
<k>
<p>
Still, despite my fears, we
must continue to hope that
they are alive somewhere.
<k> stg5_muj_03 <diary>
Month ☆ Day ○×
<wait 250>
Three days on the isle now,
and the huts are all finished.

<k> stg5_muj_94_02 Wow, sure is bright today...
<wait 250>
Hey, in case I don't say it
enough, thanks for saving us.
<k> stg5_muj_94_03 I need to get back to
Rogueport where my brother
is waiting...
<k> stg5_muj_94_04 I didn't know what to do,

But ghosts attacked us...
<wait 250>
And our boat just sank...
<wait 250>
But I've found you now!

I should say he won't be too

And thus our adventure came
to an exciting end, ah?
<k>
<p>
The ship sailed smoothly on
to Rogueport, <wait 250>and soon we
saw the harbor off our bow.
<k>
<p>
I did not find treasure, but
I am satisfied nonetheless,
strange though it sounds.
<k>
<p>
For I have found something
even more precious than
doubloons. Yes...
<k>

Even now, I hear the crew
readying to dock.<wait 250> The time is
ripe to close this journal.

Why would I have that?

<p>
...But, er, yes, by the way...
<wait 250>
Flavio is merely curious...
<wait 300>
What do you need it for?
<k> stg5_muj_31_02 What, now?<wait 250> The admiral may
soon perish?<wait 250> And he wants to
drink it as his last wish?

with here is a sort of last
request, am I correct?

Well, Flavio has no choice.

Hmmm, yes...

<p>
I am sure there is something
on this island that would be
a suitable replacement...

exchange for this delectable
Chuckola Cola, hmmm?
<k>
<p>
Make it good!<wait 250> I am the editor

<k> stg5_muj_31_02_04 Mmm...<wait 250> I must be honest,
this is not what Flavio had
hoped for...
<k>
<p>
Perhaps something a little
more "deserted-island chic,"
if you know my meaning?
<k> stg5_muj_31_02_05 Ah...<wait 250>HA!<wait 250> A Coconut, is it not?
<wait 250>
Well, that IS island fare, but

<k>
<p>
Ah, well, perhaps I had set my

<p>
Well, here you go!<wait 250> Take the
Chuckola Cola...<wait 250>and give my

<k> stg5_muj_71_02 Hey, isn't that...<wait 250>Bobbery?
<wait 250>
H-He's been alive all this
time? <wait 250>Really?
<k>
<p>
Unless...<wait 250>that's his ghost!
<k> stg5_muj_71_03 Listen, guy, sorry about the
whole leaving-you thing...
<wait 250>
What happened afterward?
<k>
<p>
All we could do was hope
for the best as we ran
away as fast as possible.
<k> stg5_muj_71_04 Oy, who's that behind you?
<wait 250>
Why, that's Bobbery, that is!
<wait 250>
Welcome back, old bomb!
<k> stg5_muj_71_05 Captain 'Stache!<wait 250> 'Ow goes it?
<wait 250>
Will you ever find Bobbery,
you think?
<k> stg5_muj_71_06 You'd better stock up on
items before going deep into
the jungle, I think!
<k>
<p>
This island is just stinking
with ghosts, I can feel it!
<wait 250>
Smells like scary...
<k> stg5_muj_71_07 If I live my whole life here,
will I turn into one of
those ghosts, too?
<k> stg5_muj_71 Ah!<wait 250> It is Bobbery!
<wait 250>
Welcome back to you!
<k>
<p>
Do you know how worried we
were?!? <wait 250>My stomach has
been most upset!
<k>
<p>
I must worry about everyone
here, but who worries for
Flavio?<wait 250> No one!
<k>
<p>
Do you know how hard that
is for me, to sit here in
safety and worry so much?
<k>
<p>
I do not know what is out
there, waiting to lurch in
and snack upon me!
<k>
<p>
We do not even know how to
get home, for the sake of
the blue, briny sea!
<k>
<p>
But no more yelling!<wait 250> Now is
the time to pull together and
work as a team!
<k> stg5_muj_72_bom Flavio, old boy...<wait 250> I must say...
<wait 250>
You talk rather too much.
<k> stg5_muj_79 Such insolence! <wait 250>Grrrrrrrrr!
<wait 250>
I growl at you like an angry
jungle beast!<wait 250> I ought to...
<k> stg5_muj_80 ...So in any case, Mario...
<wait 250>
About that Crystal Star you
spoke of earlier...
<k>
<p>
There was a rather odd rock
in the far east of the jungle
with a skull carved into it...
<k>
<p>
Call it an old sea bomb's
intuition,<wait 100> but that skull rock
smells...<wait 100>suspicious.
<k> stg5_muj_81 Heh heh... <wait 250>Hey, Bobbery.
<wait 250>
You wanna know what really
smells suspicious?
<k> stg5_muj_81_01 <scale 0.67>
<small><wave>
Flavio's armpit!
<wait 500> stg5_muj_81_02 Oy, smells like low tide!
<wait 250>
WAAAR HAR HAR HAR HAR!
<wait 250>
But, seriously...
<k>
<p>
You may be onto somefin' wif
that skull rock...<wait 250> I say that's
where the treasure is...
<k> stg5_muj_82 Well, anyone could figure
that out, you mutinous joker.
<wait 250>
I mean, HOW obvious!
<k>
<p>
I was already saying in my
head that the treasure is
certainly behind that rock!
<k>
<p>
And as such, I will continue
the noble duty of protecting
this camp from invasion...
<k>
<p>
Captain Mario!<wait 250> Carry on!
<wait 250>
I am sorry to make so many
requests, but, you know...
<k> stg5_muj_83 Flavio, you old cash-grubber!
<wait 250>
If you want treasure, why
don't you go get it yourself?
<k> stg5_muj_84 Oh, well...<wait 250> Yes, uh, Admiral...
<wait 250>
You see, I...
<k> stg5_muj_85 ...Well, yes, you have a point.
<wait 250>
Let us decide this fair and
square, shall we?
<k>
<p>
Listen to me, everyone!
<wait 250>
Who thinks I should go along
to investigate the skull rock?
<k> stg5_muj_86 <small>
<scale 0.67>
Oh, heck YES!
<wait 1000> stg5_muj_87 <small>
<scale 0.67>
Yeah, take
him, please!
<wait 1000> stg5_muj_88 <small>
<scale 0.67>
Have fun out
there, jerk!
<wait 1000> stg5_muj_88_01 <small>
<scale 0.67>
Off with you!
<wait 1000> stg5_muj_89 There you have it, Flavio!
<wait 250>
Fair and square, eh wot?
<k> stg5_muj_90 ...Um, no. <wait 250>Not fair.
<wait 250>
Flavio hates you all.
<k> stg5_sys_00 <system>
Flavio will join you for a
short time!
<k> stg5_muj_90_00 The skull rock sounds a bit
stomach-turning, but...<wait 250>I'm sure
you guys will be all right!
<k> stg5_muj_90_01 Hey, uh...<wait 250> That skull rock you
mentioned sounds interesting.
<wait 250>
Lemme know what you find!
<k> stg5_muj_90_02 Skull rock...<wait 250> Somethin' smells
suspicious there...<wait 250> It's so
smelly, I can't get near it!
<k> stg5_muj_90_02_01 So, Bobbery...<wait 250> You're off to
'ave a peep at the skull rock
wif Captain 'Stache?
<k>
<p>
I'd be right there wif you,
but me gram-gram told me
once, "No skull rocks!" so...
<k>
<p>
So, you'd better back up
Captain 'Stache wifout me,
all right, mate?
<k> stg5_muj_90_10 Ah, Mario!<wait 250> That treasure...
<wait 250>
It is certainly in that cave
somewhere! <wait 250>Flavio feels it!
<k>
<p>
So hop to it, you wonderful
little man, and find me the
goods with all speed!
<k> stg5_muj_90_11 Wow, so you're actually going
into that cave now?<wait 250> Oooh...
<wait 250>
The thought makes me woozy.
<k>
<p>
Please, be very careful...
<k> stg5_muj_90_12 Buh huh!<wait 250> I mean, har har!
<wait 250>
The cave opened?<wait 250> Really...
<wait 250>
Hmmm...<wait 250> Hmmmmmmmm...
<k>
<p>
Oh, no, I mean, NOT "hmmm"...
<wait 250>
Don't listen to me, OK?
<wait 250>
Good luck out there!
<k> stg5_muj_90_13 It opened up, did it now?
<wait 250>
Righto!<wait 250> But I bet that nasty
Cortez is in there, too...
<k>
<p>
...In there waiting...
<k> stg5_muj_90_132_01 Bobbery!<wait 250> Yer finally goin'
into the cave?!?
<k>
<p>
Well, I guess you could rattle
ol' Cortez's bones wif that
blast o' yours, eh?
<k> stg5_muj_90_14 Yeah...<wait 250> Treasure is cool...
<wait 250>
But facing Cortez for it?
<wait 250>
Not sure it's worth THAT...
<k> stg5_muj_90_15 A real pirate's pirate...
<wait 250>
Yup, Cortez, the pirate king...
<wait 250>
He must be pretty nasty...
<k> stg5_muj_90_16 What?!?<wait 250> Four-Eyes sold us
up the river?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, that actually makes
sense...<wait 250> I guess he always
WAS a bit fishy...
<k> stg5_muj_90_17 Huh?!?<wait 250> Four-Eyes was a bad
guy all this time?!?
<k>
<p>
...<wait 250>And I thought he was a
pretty straight shooter...

<o> shop_30 Ahoy, Captain 'Stache!
<wait 250>
Is this your first time

<k>
<p>
Let me explain the shop-point
system for you, OK?

 shop_31 You earn one shop point for
each item you buy.
<k>
<p>
Now, as you build up points,
you get rewarded with great
prizes, including rare items.
<k>
<p>
Different stores have

<k>
<p>
And that's it!

<wait 250>
But it ain't got excitement,

Sometimes it makes me just

And the admiral! <wait 250>Corkin'!

stuff, but I gotta say...
<wait 250>
That's really somefin'!

to me...
<k> stg5_muj_155 Those Piantas were all upset
about something before...
<wait 250>
What happened?
<k> stg5_muj_156 I'd love to find a headstrong
woman like that Francesca.
<wait 250>
'Cause, you know...

<p>
Everybody likes to be bossed
around now and then...
<k> stg5_muj_157 Frankie's the big boss of
the whole syndicate now, eh?
<wait 250>
Well, what do you know...
<k>
<p>
I guess you can't judge a
Pianta by his fronds...
<k> stg5_muj_158 I'm getting sick of island life...

<wait 250>
I hear the sea calling me...
<k> stg5_muj_159 Traveling by boat is nice.
<wait 250>
But I wouldn't mind traveling
in style by train sometime.
<k> stg5_muj_160 This is not a deserted island,
you know.<wait 250> I mean, we're here,
aren't we?
<k> stg5_muj_161 My dream is to someday have
my own boat!<wait 250> And I don't
mean some little paper boat!
<k> stg5_muj_162 What's that you've got?
<wait 250>
A ticket for the Excess

You must be richer than you
look! <wait 250>MUCH richer...
<k> stg5_muj_163 I've been to the Glitz Pit

<k> stg5_muj_165 The Piantas?
<k>
<p>
I think they're off in the
jungle there.<wait 250> They're probably
smooching or something.
<k>
<p>
Man, am I jealous...
<k> stg5_muj_166 Ahhh, the sea is the best!
<wait 250>
Just looking at it makes me
forget about all my cares!
<k> stg5_muj_167 The coconut milk here is
just the best!<wait 250> You should
try it sometime!
<k> stg5_muj_168 Is it true that they're going
to put up a big resort here?
<wait 250>
I am completely opposed!
<k>
<p>
You think we could get the
pirate king to curse the
developers?<wait 250> That might do it!
<k> stg5_muj_168_1 Is it true that they're going

Bobbery goes out to sea
every day now with Cortez...
<wait 250>
I think his soul has healed.
<k>
<p>
I ran into him on Keelhaul
Key by accident the other
day, which was nice.
<k>
<p>
He was so happy, I thought
he was going to blow up on
me for a second there.
<k>
<p>
You know... I bet Scarlette is
looking down on him and
smiling right now.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and I almost forgot...
<wait 250>
Everyone on Keelhaul Key is
well, and they say hello.
<k>
 msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is a shantytown built
by Pa-Patch and some of the
sailors who came with us.
<k>
<p>
Blue ocean, sandy beaches...
<wait 300>
A shop, an inn... You could live
pretty comfily here.
<k>
<p>
You'd always have to worry
about harmful UV rays,
though, y'know?
<k> ガラの悪い水夫 <keyxon>
That's Pa-Patch the Bob-omb.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's a salty old sailor, and
a totally solid deckhand.
<k>
<p>
I heard he built all these
shanties by himself, too!
<wait 300>
...Still, he's afraid of ghosts.
<k> マルコ <keyxon>
That's the entrepreneur,
Flavio.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He calls himself the
leader of this group.
<k>
<p>
He's a funny enough guy...
<wait 300>
but he mostly loafs around
and makes folks do his work.
<k>
<p>
Not much of a leader, huh?
<wait 250>
...But WHAT a dresser!
<k> 水夫A <keyxon>
That's a Toad sailor.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He was with us on the ship,
you remember?
<k>
<p>
He seems like a hard worker.
<wait 300>
Doesn't he look reliable?
<k> 水夫D <keyxon>
That's one of the
shipwrecked Toads.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He 
crashed just like we did.
<k>
<p>
He seems to have taken well
to the island life, though.
<wait 300>
What an optimistic guy!
<k> めがね水夫 <keyxon>
This guy's called Four-Eyes.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's one of the sailors who
came along to Keelhaul Key.
<k>
<p>
It's the weirdest thing...
<wait 250>
I feel like I've seen him
somewhere before, though...
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
...Maybe I'm just nuts.
<k> オドオド水夫 <keyxon>
That's the timid Toad sailor.
<k>
<p>
He came looking for his
brother, who was lost at sea,
<wait 300>
and now he is, too...
<k> 店員 <keyxon>
That's Thriff T. the Toad.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He came to Keelhaul Key to
open his own store...
<k>
<p>
But I don't think this is
quite what he had in mind,
know what I mean?
<k>
<p>
Then again, maybe this is
even better in some ways...
<k> 宿店員 <keyxon>
That's a Toad girl.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She runs an inn of sorts
in this tent.
<k>
<p>
It may look totally budget,
but this is a real business!
<k> モニー <keyxon>
That's Francesca the Pianta.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She's "well connected," get
me?<wait 300> Her dad's a big boss.
<k>
<p>
She doesn't crave money or
power or anything like that,
though.<wait 250> She lives for love.
<k>
<p>
Doesn't that, like, totally
melt your heart?<wait 250> People
could learn from this girl!
<k> ピートン <keyxon>
That's Francesca's boyfriend,
Frankie.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's the future of
the Pianta syndicate.
<k>
<p>
Hard to believe, isn't it?
<wait 250>
Still, he's the number-two
guy after Don Pianta.
<k>
<p>
You'd think he'd be this
tough guy, but Francesca has
him eating out of her hand.
<k> ボロ水夫A <keyxon>
That's one of the
shipwrecked Toads.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He 
crashed just like we did.
<k>
<p>
He seems to have taken well
to the island life, though.
<wait 300>
What an optimistic guy!
<k> ボロ水夫B <keyxon>
That's one of the
shipwrecked Toads.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He 
crashed just like we did.
<k>
<p>
He seems to be living a fine,
productive life here, though.
<wait 300>
He must be super-adaptive...
<k> 水夫ボム兵 <keyxon>
That's a Bob-omb sailor.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's one of the guys who
came here with us.
<k>
<p>
You think Bob-omb sailors
have any trouble with their
fuses getting wet?
<k> ３人娘Ａ <keyxon>
These are the Traveling
Sisters 3.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> They seem to go
everywhere together.
<k>
<p>
They seem so ditzy, though.
<wait 250>
Do they even notice each
new place they wind up in?
<k> ３人娘Ｂ <keyxon>
These are the Traveling
Sisters 3.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> It looks like
they're having fun.
<k>
<p>
They seem to just flit off
to each new place without
really exploring anywhere.
<k> ３人娘Ｃ <keyxon>
These are the Traveling

something may eat it!

You don't think Bobbery's
just like, sleeping, do you?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, he totally IS! <wait 250>And I
was so worried about him!
<wait 250>
Smack him awake, will you?
<k> stg5_muj_49_nok Hey, ummm...<wait 250>Mario?
<wait 250>
Do you think maybe Bobbery's
just sleeping really heavily?
<k>
<p>
You know what?<wait 250> He is!
<wait 250>
And I was so depressed!
<wait 250>
Whack him and wake him up!
<k> stg5_muj_49_win I say...<wait 250> Mario, dear?
<wait 250>
I can't help but think that
Bobbery may just be sleeping.
<k>
<p>
Yes, I am quite sure of it!
<wait 250>
And I worried so!<wait 250> Give him
a rude awakening, will you?
<k> stg5_muj_49_yos Hey! <wait 250>Gonzales!

Give him a wake-up whack!
<k> stg5_muj_49_viv Uh...<wait 250>Mario?<wait 250> I think...

I really think Bobbery's just
sleeping, after all that.

<p>
Yeah, I'm sure of it, actually!
<wait 250>

<wait 250>
Whack him awake, will you?
<k> stg5_muj_49_chu Mmmmm...<wait 250> Mario, sweetie?
<wait 250>
I believe Bobbery may just
be sleeping...

<wait 250>
A dead end, taunting Flavio

ancient secrets, yes?<wait 250> Let us

There is a space in one of
the eyes where you could
conceivably place something.
<k> stg5_muj_93_01_01_kur Hey, Mario...<wait 250> You think maybe
that thing Flavio's got might
go into the eyehole here?
<k> stg5_muj_93_01_01_nok Ummm... Mario?<wait 250> Maybe that
thing Flavio has goes into
the space in the eye here...
<k> stg5_muj_93_01_01_win Mario, darling...<wait 250> Perhaps that
gem of Flavio's might fit
into the space in the eye!
<k> stg5_muj_93_01_01_yos Hey, Gonzales!<wait 250> Doesn't Flavio
have a gem that might fit
in that eyehole?
<k> stg5_muj_93_01_01_viv Uh, Mario...<wait 250> You don't suppose
Flavio's gem might go in the
space in the eye, do you?
<k> stg5_muj_93_01_01_bom Mario, old boy...<wait 250> I've a gut
feeling that Flavio's gem
might fit in that eyehole...
<k> stg5_muj_93_01_01_chu Mario, dearie...<wait 250> I think that
Flavio's gem might be just
the thing for that eyehole...

<dynamic 3>
YOOOOOOOOOUUUUUUUUUU!
</dynamic>
<wait 250>
You have the Skull Gem!
<k> stg5_dou_36_02 ...Uh, yes, yes, I do, so...
<wait 250>
All right, what do you say
to this proposition, then?
<k>
<p>
Take the gem handed down
through generations of my
family, and lend us your ship!
<k>
<p>
I think that is a pretty
fair deal,<wait 250> do you not
think, Cortez, old friend?
<k> stg5_dou_36_03 <boss>
...Old friend? <wait 250>Your ancestors
stole that gem from me,
<wait 250>
you strutting peacock!
<k>
<p>
You must be very brave or
very, VERY foolish to ask
such a thing of me!
<k>
<p>
I should turn you into a
pinata and throw a party
on the beach!
<k> stg5_dou_36_04 <dynamic 3>
W-W-W-Wait just a moment!
</dynamic><wait 250>
Do not make me have Mario
trounce you again!
<k>
<p>
While he fights you, I will
throw this stone into the sea
where you will never find it!
<k>
<p>
How would that be?
</shake>
<k> stg5_dou_36_05 <boss>
RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGH!

<k>
<p>
I accept your bargain, amigo!
<wait 250>
Now, be very careful with
that gem!
<k> stg5_dou_36_06 Ah! <wait 250>Check and mate, Flavio!
<wait 250>
I did not make my fortune by
failing in negotiation, no!
<k>
<p>
You can talk your way
through any deal, I say!
<wait 250>
Now, you take this...
<k> stg5_dou_37 <boss>
Ahhhh! <wait 250>Now my precious
Black Skull will sail the
seas again!
<k>
<p>
I was getting quite annoyed
by the sound of cannons
outside, anyway!
<k>
<p>
Now I can really stretch my
bones and wreak havoc on
the seas like in the old days!
<k> stg5_dou_38 So, Mario!<wait 250> Feel free to thank
me anytime for saving us all!
<wait 250>
But for now...<wait 250>we sail!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Cortez's room, all right.
<wait 300>
I guess you'd call this the
captain's cabin.
<k>
<p>
Sure is a lot of treasure
in here...<wait 300> You could live many
lives of luxury with this...
<k>
<p>
And I'll tell you, lots of this
stuff has archaeological
value, as well...
<k>
<p>
You think maybe we could
pocket a little bit without
Cortez noticing?

ep_27 They are all such lovely
people, don't you think?

 ep_28 I don't have too many good
memories of Rogueport, what
with the kidnapping and all...

<p>
But it really is a vibrant
town full of love for life,
isn't it?
<k> ep_29 Mario...<wait 500> I was very frightened
when they took me.

<p>
<wait 100>
But...
<wait 100>
<k>
<p>
Well...<wait 250> TEC was really there
for me and helped me get
through it all.
<k>
<p>
And I knew that you would
come to help me, as well...
<wait 250>
I always believe in that...
<k>
<p>
Thank you, Mario.
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
I... <wait 250>Maybe I should listen to
Toadsworth and behave more
like a princess from now on...

stg1_nok_01 Welcome, travelers!
<k> stg1_nok_01_01 Hm? <wait 50>Where are you, you ask?
<wait 250>
Why, this is <col c00000ff>Petalburg</col>!
<k>
<p>
Sorry, but it's been a long
time since we've had visitors
here. <wait 250>We're kind of remote.
<k>
<p>
Yeppity, once that dragon
Hooktail was spotted flying
around this area...
<k>
<p>
Well, it didn't help tourism,
put it that way.<wait 250> People just
stopped visiting.
<k> stg1_nok_01_02 Dragon?<wait 250> Hooktail?
<wait 250>
That must've been that huge
thing we saw earlier, Mario!
<k>
<p>
So, it's called Hooktail, huh?
<wait 250>
Oooooh, scary name!<wait 250> Pffffft!
<k>
<p>
So anyway, Green Boots, have
you ever heard of these
things called Crystal Stars?
<k>
<p>
We're on this quest for them.<wait 250> 
It's very important!
<k> stg1_nok_01_03 Crystal Stars, you say?
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
Hmmm...<wait 250> Nope, can't say that
I have. <wait 250>Sorry about that.
<k>
<p>
You might want to speak with
the mayor, though.<wait 250> He's old...<wait 250> 
Really, really old. 
<k>
<p>
As such, he knows all kinds
of stuff we don't. <wait 250>Koopas of
his age, are...<wait 250>um...<wait 250>really smart.
<k>
<p>
Anyway, the mayor lives in
that pink house up ahead.<wait 250> 
You should go check it out.
<k> stg1_nok_01_04 A pink house?
<k>
<p>
Sounds totally hideous...<wait 250>but
it should be easy to find.
<k>
<p>
Thanks for your help!
<k> stg1_nok_02 Visitors are sure rare here,
but they're always welcome!<wait 250> 
Make yourselves at home.
<k> stg1_nok_02_01 I don't know if you know, but
there's an odd-shaped
boulder west of the village.
<k>
<p>
Yeppity, that thing's been
around since way before I
was even born.
<k>
<p>
I figure it must be a relic of
a long-lost civilization.
<wait 250>
Sounds cool, right?
<k> stg1_nok_03 You know, I bet there's a
whole world we know nothing
about past Hooktail's castle.
<k>
<p>
But...wait! <wait 250>Don't tell me!
<wait 250>
I want to see it for myself!
<wait 250>
You know, explore. <wait 250>Like you!
<k> stg1_nok_03_1 I want to have an adventure
like you guys.<wait 250> Actually, I even
went to Hooktail Castle once.
<k>
<p>
And you know what?<wait 250> The
drawbridge over the moat
was busted. <wait 250>I couldn't get in.
<k>
<p>
How did you guys manage to
get across that moat with
the drawbridge broken, huh?
<k> stg7_nok_01 Huh? <wait 250>What's that?
<wait 250>
General White?
<k>
<p>
Oh, he was here a while ago,
but he said he was taking
a trip.<wait 250> And then he left.
<k>
<p>
Wait, hang on a sec'...
<wait 250>
He did say something about a
deserted isle to the south...
<k>
<p>
He was either going there...
<wait 250>
or NOT going there...
<k> stg7_nok_01_1 I want to have an adventure
like you guys.<wait 250> Actually, I even
went to Hooktail Castle once.

was busted.<wait 250> I couldn't get in.
<k>
<p>
How are you guys going to

the drawbridge broken, huh?
<k> stg1_nok_04 You saw Hooktail on your way
here? <wait 250>Are you sure?<wait 250> Big old
dragon, tail like a hook?
<k>
<p>
Wow, you're super-duper lucky
it didn't see you! <wait 250>I'm not
even kidding with you.
<k>
<p>
If it'd seen you, I'm sure
it would've gobbled you up
like an after-dinner mint.
<k>
<p>
It must've been stuffed or
thought you looked gross...
<wait 250>
At any rate, you were lucky.
<k> stg1_nok_04_01 Wait, my ears must be broken.
<wait 250>
Did you say you're planning
on battling Hooktail?
<k>
<p>
That sounds like a bad joke!
<wait 250>
And here's the punchline:<wait 50> you,
squished to paper-thinness!
<k> stg1_nok_05 Some rumormonger told me
you guys defeated Hooktail...
<wait 250>
That's just a joke, right?
<k>
<p>
Whaaaat? <wait 250>It's true?!?
<k>
<p>
No way! <wait 250>I figured it was
gonna crumple you up and
throw you in its trash can!
<k> stg1_nok_05_1 So, it's true that you guys
defeated Hooktail?
<wait 250>
Wow! <wait 250>I'm sorry I doubted you.
<k>
<p>
But really...<wait 250> Do you blame me?
<wait 250>
I mean, you're so skinny!<wait 250> 
You're wafer-thin!

<k> stg1_nok_06 Hey, what's up?<wait 250> I gotta say,
I'm really hooked on playing
GBA games lately.
<k>
<p>
There's this one game that
just absolutely rules.<wait 250> It's
called "Fire Emblem"...
<k>
<p>
You ever heard of it?
<wait 250>
Man, it ROCKS MY SOCKS!!!
<k> stg1_nok_06_01 Hey, what's shaking?<wait 250> I gotta
say, I've been playing a lot of
Nintendo 64 games recently.
<k>
<p>
You know the N64, right?
<wait 250>
Well, the game I play the
most on it is "Paper Mario."
<k>
<p>
There's this girl in the game,
Bow, who's pretty much the
cutest Boo OF ALL TIME!!!
<k> stg1_nok_07 Hey, I gotta say, all I do is
play my Nintendo GameCube.
<wait 250>
Best system ever, am I right?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, I think so, too.<wait 250> Anyway,
I saved up for a new game...
<wait 250>
The sequel to "Paper Mario"!
<k>
<p>
I just got started, but it's
a blast so far. <wait 250>A BLAAAST!
<wait 250>
Try it for yourself and see!
<k> stg1_nok_07_1 I've been playing "Paper
Mario: The Thousand-Year
Door" like crazy lately...
<k>
<p>
I wasn't sure at first...
<wait 250>
But that game is AWESOME!
<wait 250>
I just beat it!<wait 250> Every chapter!
<k>
<p>
Totally cool ending!<wait 250> I
loved it.<wait 250> So worth the money!
<wait 250>
Think there'll be a sequel?
<k>
<p>
If not, I hope they make a
Paper Luigi game. <wait 250>Yeah!<wait 250> I bet
that'd be awesome, too...
<k> stg1_nok_07_1_1 I've gotta say, I've been
playing the new Paper
Mario game almost nonstop.
<k>
<p>
I'm on the fence so far...<wait 300> 
Gotta put serious time into
a game to review it properly.
<k>
<p>
But I can definitely tell you
this: <wait 250>if you're a Luigi fan,
do NOT miss out on this one!
<k> stg1_nok_08 Hey, uh... <wait 250>Well, come on in,
I guess!<wait 250> Door's open!
<k>
<p>
Oh, Hooktail?<wait 250> It lives at
the top of that old castle
beyond this hummock.
<k>
<p>
Have you heard the rumors?
<wait 250>
Some say lots of treasure
is hidden in that castle.
<k>
<p>
Scores of people have gone in
search of it, but...<wait 250>not a one
has returned.
<k>
<p>
So...<wait 250>what do you think?
<wait 250>
You're getting scared, huh?
<k> stg1_nok_08_01 You're going to the castle?
<wait 250>
You're really dying to get
that treasure, aren't you?
<k>
<p>
Careful... <wait 250>I've heard that
Hooktail's not the only nasty
beast in that castle.
<k>
<p>
I'd love some treasure, too,
but do I want to become a
snack for it? <wait 250>No thanks!
<k>
<p>
We Koopas are long-lived for
a reason, you know.<wait 250> Good luck
being digested and all. 
<k> stg1_nok_09 You beat Hooktail? <wait 250>Wow!
<wait 250>
Hey, so tell me...
<wait 250>
Find any treasure?
<o> stg1_nok_09_yesno <select 0 1 0 40>
You bet we did!
Who needs treasure?
None of your beeswax! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0>  stg1_nok_09_01 <p>
Oh, OK...
<k>
<p>
They say the Koopas who
perished there<wait 250> cursed the
place with their regret.
<k>
<p>
So, anyone who claims the
treasure will lose all his
strength. <wait 250>Yeah. Nasty, huh?
<k>
<p>
...So, what do you think?
<wait 250>
You scared now, or what?
<wait 250>
Ha! <wait 250>I'm just messing with you!

I am Bub-ulber.

You came here after hearing
of my request, correct?<wait 250> 
Ah! <wait 250>I am so happy!
<k>
<p>
I would like to ask you to
bring me a Hot Dog. <wait 250>Yes, a
Hot Dog is what I desire.
<k>
<p>
It is said to be "spicy,"
but I've never experienced
"spiciness" in all my life.
<k>
<p>
Some say they are sold in
Glitzville. <wait 250>Please get one
for me, if you can.
<k> irai_15_002 Oh, did you bring something
for me?
<k>
<o> irai_15_003 Oh! <wait 250>So this is a Hot Dog!<wait 250> 
I'm going to go right ahead

Munch, smack, gulp...<wait 250>URP!<wait 250> 
Oh!<wait 50> Oh, HOT!<wait 50> HOT, HOT!<wait 50> 
SO THIS IS "SPICY"!
<k>
<p>
Well, this "spiciness" is
quite interesting.<wait 250> It makes
me crave more of it.
<k>
<p>
I'm terribly sorry, but could
you get me one more Hot
Dog, please? <wait 250>I must have one.
<k>
<p>
I would appreciate it.
<k> irai_15_004 Oh!<wait 50> I'm so happy to be able
to eat another Hot Dog!<wait 250> 
I've dreamed of this!
<k>
<p>
I shall devour it immediately!<wait 250> 
Munch, slurp, gulp...<wait 250>URP!<wait 250> 
Oh!<wait 250> Oh, HOT!<wait 50> HOT, HOT!<wait 250>

SPICY! <wait 250>SPICY HOTNESS!<wait 250> 
Now this...<wait 250> THIS IS
SPIIIIIIIIICY!!!
<k>
<p>
Oh, my. <wait 250>That was positively
delicious!<wait 250> Good gracious!<wait 250> 
I'm sweating with pleasure.
<k>
<p>
I'm rather surprised that
it was SPIIIIIIIIIIICY
rather than just SPICY.
<k>
<p>
By the way, and I know this
is rather rude, but I'd love
to chase that with a sweet.
<k>
<p>
Sweets are the spice of life!<wait 250> 
That's my new theory I've
just now coined.
<k>
<p>
Could you maybe cook some
Cake Mix?<wait 250> Please?<wait 250> I really
want a piece of Mousse Cake.
<k> irai_15_005 Oh! <wait 250>Mousse Cake! <wait 250>I can't
wait to eat, so I won't!
<k>
<p>
Munch, snark, yum...<wait 250>URP!<wait 250> 
Oooooooh!<wait 250> Sweet!
<k>
<p>
Good gracious! <wait 250>I am quite
satisfied now.<wait 250> But I feel
like I've been demanding...
<k>
<p>
Maybe I just wanted to be
spoiled by others.<wait 250> Maybe I
was so selfish because...
<k>
<p>
Well, because it's such a
peaceful place. <wait 250>I crave
peace, love...<wait 250>and food.
<k>
<p>
I'm sure that's it.<wait 250> Anyway,
let me show my gratitude.
<k> irai_15_007 I've been growing these
Dried Bouquets lately.
<k>
<p>
If you want more, just bring
me another Hot Dog.
<k>
<p>
You'll always be welcome
here. <wait 250>Thank you so much!
<k>
 irai_15_008 <p>

I remain sure this is the key
to restoring happiness here.
<k> stg1_nok_21 Rejoice! <wait 250>The fearful Hooktail
is gone, and everyone is of
good cheer once again!
<k>
<p>
I truly hope that now people
will begin to visit this
village once more.
<k> stg1_nok_21_1 This town is very peaceful.
<wait 250>
Yes, and that is why there
are so many flowers.
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250>I have heard there are
places in the world where
no flowers bloom.
<k>
<p>
I could never forgive myself if
I did nothing to try to bring
flowers to such places.
<k>
<p>
That is why I shoot out
spores as often as I can.<wait 250> 
It is my civic duty!

<k> stg1_nok_22 Boy, the mayor has been so
forgetful lately.
<k>
<p>
I'm actually worried the old
gipper may even forget my
face one of these days!

<k>
<p>
I'm actually worried the old

<k> stg1_nok_23 Sniff... <wait 250>SNIFFFFFFFF...
<wait 20>
The scent of this grass has
healing properties, I swear.
<k>
<p>
It just takes me to a happy
place, know what I mean?
<wait 250>
You think so, too, right?
<o> stg1_nok_23_yesno <select 0 1 0 40>
Boy, do I!
You're a wacko! stg1_nok_23_01 <p>
Fair enough.
<k> stg1_nok_23_01_1 You know, I've been worrying
about the mayor lately...<wait 250> 
He's been so darn forgetful...
<k>
<p>
But he says he's always been
forgetful...<wait 250> Yeah!<wait 250> Ever since
he was a kid, he says.
<k>
<p>
I guess I never should have
worried, right? <wait 250>Seriously,
what a waste of brainpower.
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250>now that I think on it...
<wait 250>
maybe I'M getting forgetful!

Now I'm worried about me...
<k> stg1_nok_24 Hey, Hooktail's scary, but
so is the monster that lives
in the fortress near town!
<k>
<p>
I mean, normal attacks are
completely useless against it!
<wait 250>
At least, that's what I heard.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and that's not all!<wait 250> Fire
attacks are ALSO useless!
<wait 250>
<shake>
The very idea freaks me out!
<k> stg1_nok_24_01 What? <wait 250>No way! <wait 250>...Really?
<wait 250>
You defeated the monster
in that fortress?
<k>
<p>
Wow! <wait 250>You must be tougher
than you look, mister!
<wait 250>
I underestimated you.
<k> stg1_nok_25 Wait... <wait 250>What did you say?
<wait 250>
You defeated Hooktail, too?
<k>
<p>
You really are cool, mister!
<wait 250>
Hey, wait a minute! <wait 250>Could you
be...<wait 250>that super-famous guy?
<k>
<p>
That guy named...<wait 250>Luigi?
<wait 250>
Yeah, you look just like him!
<wait 250>
I'm right, aren't I?
<k> stg1_nok_25_1 Hey, Mario... You're Luigi's
older brother, right?
<k>
<p>
That's so cool! I mean, you're
cool, too, and all, but I just
think Luigi is the greatest!
<k> stg1_nok_25_1_1 Hey, Mario... <wait 250>You're Luigi's

That's so rad!<wait 250> I mean, you're
rad, too, and all, but I just
think Luigi is the greatest!
<k>
<p>
See, me personally?<wait 250> I think
that being able to jump that
high is totally awesome.
<k> stg1_nok_26 An old stronghold called
Shhwonk Fortress lies ahead.
<wait 150>
A stone creature lives there.
<k>
<p>
At least, it MIGHT live there.<wait 250> 
This gate is to keep it out.
<wait 150>
My job...<wait 250>is guarding the gate.

Careful out there, though!
<k> stg1_nok_29 Umm... <wait 250>Excuse me!
<k>
<p>
Err... <wait 250>I beg your pardon!
<wait 250>
Wait a moment, PLEASE!!!
<k> stg1_nok_30 Pardon me for yelling like
that...<wait 250> I was panicking.<wait 250> 
Umm...<wait 250> How to begin?
<k>
<p>
M-My name's...<wait 250>Koops.
<k>
<p>
I heard you're traveling to
Hooktail's castle.
<k>
<p>
So, anyway, I, uh...<wait 250> 
I have a favor to ask.
<k>
<p>
......................................................................
......................................................................
......................................................................
<k>
<p>
Well...
<k>
<p>
Ummmm...
<k>
<p>
Oh, just... <wait 250>Just forget it.<wait 250> 
Never mind. <wait 250>Ignore me.<wait 250> 
Good...<wait 250> Good-bye.
<k> stg1_nok_30_01 OOOOOO-K... <wait 250>That was weird...
<wait 250>
What do you think THAT was
all about? <wait 250>Talk about issues!
<k> stg1_nok_27 Um...<wait 250> Hi there, folks.
<k>
<p>
Did you come to this village
to look for the treasure of
Hooktail's castle?
<k>
<p>
......
<k>
<p>
Well...<wait 250>that Hooktail is one
tough cookie.
<k> stg1_nok_27_01 What did you say?
<wait 250>
You mean you're actually
going to Hooktail's castle?
<k>
<p>
I can't believe you'd dare
challenge that behemoth.<wait 250> 
It eats people. <wait 250>Often!
<k>
<p>
.........
<k>
<p>
Umm... <wait 250>It's really none of my
business, but it's one scary
dragon, and that's no lie!
<k> stg1_nok_31 Ummm...<wait 250> Look, I...
<wait 250>
Listen, just forget that whole
scene I made earlier, OK?
<k>
<p>
It was nothing. <wait 250>I was just
fooling around or something.
<k> stg1_nok_31_01 You truly are going to
Hooktail's castle, aren't you?
<k>
<p>
I can't believe you have the
guts to challenge that
fearsome monster.<wait 250> Brrrrr!
<k>
<p>
...Gives me the willies...
<k>
<p>
I'm sure you know what you're
getting into, but seriously,
that thing is savage.
<k> stg1_nok_31_01_00 Be prepared for trouble, and
trouble will pass you by.<wait 250> 
That's what I always say!
<k>
<p>
By which I mean, it'd be wise
to stock up on items before
you go to Shhwonk Fortress.
<k>
<p>
I've heard there are beasts
there that you can't beat in
battle without items.
<k>
<p>
My personal recommendation?
<wait 250>
Probably POW Blocks.<wait 250> Yeah.<wait 250> 
They're always a solid choice.
<k> stg1_nok_31_01_01 You defeated the fabled
stone monster of Shhwonk?
<wait 250>
Whoa!<wait 250> Well done!
<k>
<p>
But wait...<wait 250> Hold on, now...
<wait 250>
That means I have no more
job, doesn't it?
<k>
<p>
Well, what do you suppose I
should do now, huh?
<wait 250>
What a pickle...
<k> stg1_nok_31_02 Huh? Did I hear that right?
The stone monster appeared?
So, the stories were true...
<k>
<p>
You'd better go and buy some
items then. You know, just to
be on the safe side.
<k>
<p>
Yup, that'd be a smart move.
<wait 250>
And the shopkeeper will be
psyched to see you, too.
<k> stg1_nok_31_02_1 Huh?!?
<wait 250>
You say you beat Hooktail???
<wait 250>
That's incredible!<wait 250> Amazing!
<k>
<p>
So I guess that means your
adventure is finally over, eh?
<k>
<p>
What?<wait 250> It's only just begun?!?
<wait 250>
Wow, really?
<k>
<p>
In that case, you'd better
stock up on more items.
<wait 250>
I bet they'll come in handy!
<k> stg1_nok_31_02_2 Thanks to you, it'll be calm
here again. <wait 250>Of course, peace
and quiet is bad for business.
<k>
<p>
Nobody goes in that shop
anymore.<wait 250> The business world
is a rough place, man...
<k>
<p>
Hey!<wait 250> Buy some items once in
a while!<wait 250> The guy in the shop
sure would appreciate it!

<k> stg1_nok_32 Hey, since you're here, let
me ask: <wait 250>how many people do
you think Hooktail's gobbled?
<k>
<p>
All time, I mean. <wait 250>I heard
it recently lunched on old
man Skoo two villages over...
<k>
<p>
And Koops, who lives next
door? <wait 250>His father went off to
battle Hooktail ages ago.
<k>
<p>
He's been a missing person...
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
No, wait, that's not right...
<wait 250>
A missing KOOPA ever since!
<k> stg1_nok_32_01 I live in constant fear of
Hooktail swooping down to
attack this village...
<k>
<p>
That's why I'm always telling
my kids not to wander too
far from home.
<k> stg1_nok_33 What do you mean, Koops's
father was living inside
Hooktail's stomach?
<k>
<p>
Wow, Koopley RULES!
<wait 250>
Hooktail bit off more than
it could chew this time!
<k> stg1_nok_33_1 Koopley tries to play it off,
but he's actually worried sick
over what'll happen to Koops.
<k>
<p>
He should know, though: <wait 50>Don't
judge a person...<wait 250> No...<wait 250> Don't
judge a Koopa by its shell.

sound silly or anything, but...

Here to rob a defenseless
old Koopa! <wait 250>Despicable!
<k> stg1_nok_38 Go on, do what you will...<wait 250> 
but as you can plainly see,
there's nothing to steal here.
<k>
<p>
Oh, I guess I have a little
money...<wait 250> Take it, you fiends. <wait 250> 
And my antique shell, too.
<k>
<p>
Just leave the photos of me
and the missus. <wait 250>Can't do
without those memories...
<k> stg1_nok_39 What? <wait 250>Not thieves, you say?
<k>
<p>
Well, what's your story, then?
<wait 250>
Oh, wait... <wait 250>You folks looking
for Crystal Stars?
<k> stg1_nok_40 Well, why didn't you pipe up
before, you ijit!<wait 250> We're just

<p>
Errrmm... <wait 250>Wait...
<wait 250>
What did I hear about those
dang things, again?
<k>
<p>
Aha! <wait 250>Got it!
<wait 250>
Hooktail! <wait 250>Hooktail's got what
you're looking for!
<k>
<p>
It's this enormous, ornery
dragon. <wait 250>Eats folks, they say.<wait 250> 
You know Hooktail, right?
<o> stg1_nok_40_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Of course!
I may have heard the name. stg1_nok_41 <p>
Well, this Hooktail's brutal
fly-by snackings have all of
us on pins and needles. 
<k>
<p>
So, are you reckless fools...

I mean...<wait 250> Are you gallant

You got it!
What? Hold on, now! stg1_nok_42 <p>
This DOES sound promising!
<k>
<p>
Why, if you can rid us of
Hooktail, we'll shower you
with gratitude and rewards.
<k>
<p>
Wait, what's that I hear?
<wait 250>
You'll accept no reward?
<o> stg1_nok_42_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Of course I won't.
I didn't say that! stg1_nok_43 <p>
What an unselfish man!
<wait 250>
You're noble, indeed...
<k>
<p>
Yup, a good egg.<wait 250> Now...
<wait 250>
What did you say your name
was, again?
<k> stg1_nok_44 ...Murphy?
<k>
<p>
Hmm... <wait 250>That's a fine name.<wait 250> 
Yes, a fine name, indeed.

Well now, Murphy...

It's "Mario."
The name is "Mario"! stg1_nok_45 <p>
I appreciate that, Murphy!<wait 250> 
They ARE nice eyebrows.
<wait 250>
Now, listen up.
<k>
<p>
If you're intent on going to
Hooktail's castle, find the
secret pipe near this village.
<k>
<p>
I don't know where it's at,
but I know you need <col c00000ff>stone
keys</col> to use that pipe.
<k>
<p>
The keys are somewhere in
<col c00000ff>Shhwonk Fortress</col>, just past
the village.<wait 250> Get them first.
<k> stg1_nok_46 Well then, Murphy...
<wait 250>
Get going and take care of
that Hooktail monster!
<k> stg1_nok_47 If you're intent on going to
Hooktail's castle, then find
the secret pipe near here.
<k>
<p>
To find the pipe, you'll need
the stone keys that are
hidden in Shhwonk Fortress.
<k>
<p>
Got all that, Murphy?
<wait 250>
Then get gone and take care
of that Hooktail monster!
<k> stg1_nok_56 Well done there, Murphy!
<wait 250>
Found the stone keys, have
you? <wait 250>Excellent work. 
<k>
<p>
Next, you'll need to find
the secret pipe that leads
to Hooktail's castle.
<k>
<p>
So shake a leg, Murphy!
<wait 250>
Go show that Hooktail
thing who's boss!
<k>
 stg1_nok_56_01 With you on the job, that
Hooktail's as good as gone.
<k>
<p>
I'm pulling for you, Murphy!<wait 250> 
Good luck hunting for that
Crystal Star!
<k> stg1_nok_57 Hoo, Murphy!
<wait 250>
I was sure that YOU could
get that Crystal Star!
<k> stg1_nok_57_1 Eh? <wait 250>Who's that?<wait 250> Who's there?
<wait 250>
What do you want?
<k>

You dirty thief...<wait 250> I'll poke you
but good! <wait 250>Come get some!
<wait 250>
Oh!<wait 250> If it isn't Murphy!

How've you been, Murphy?

I'm good as ever! <wait 250>Got my

<wait 250>
General White?
<k>
<p>
Hrmm?<wait 250> General... <wait 250>Hrmmmmmm.
<wait 300>
Well, I'm certain I've seen him
around...<wait 250>but not lately, no.
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
I think he may have possibly
said he might head south to
a more tropical locale...
<k>
<p>
Creaky Key?<wait 250> Was that it?
<wait 300>
Yup! <wait 50>That's it! <wait 250>That might,
possibly, perhaps, could be it...
<k> stg1_nok_57_1_1 Eh? <wait 250>Who's that?<wait 250> Who's there?
<wait 250>
What do you want?
<k>

You dirty thief...<wait 250> I'll poke you

<wait 250>
My name is Koopie Koo.
<wait 250>
It's nice to meet you.
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
...Omigosh!<wait 250> That hat! <wait 50>Those
overalls!<wait 50> And... <wait 250>And that
magnificent mustache!
<k>
<p>
You're Mario, aren't you?
<k>
 stg1_nok_64_01 I've heard tales of how
strong you are.
<k>
<p>
If you're here, that means...
<wait 250>
You're going to challenge
that monstrous Hooktail!
<k>
<p>
Ohhhhhhhhhhhh...
<wait 250>
If only Koops were as brave
as you...
<k> stg1_nok_65 My boyfriend Koops is just
sort of, well...<wait 250>wishy-washy.
<wait 250>
He's not quite timid, but...
<k>
<p>
Well, I guess I just wish he
would be more, you know,
MANLY sometimes.
<k>
<p>
Ohhhh...<wait 250> Koops...
<wait 250>
Why did I have to fall for
someone like him?
<k> stg1_nok_66 Wait... <wait 250>Was that out loud?
<k>
<p>
Don't you dare tell him I
said I've fallen for him!
<wait 250>
Please! <wait 50>I beg of you!
<k> stg1_nok_66_01 I don't know why, but Koops
has been acting odd lately.
<wait 250>
What could be bothering him?
<k>
<p>
Probably nothing.<wait 250> He's always
tweaked about something.
<k> stg1_nok_67 Oh, my dear Koops...
<wait 250>
I'm sorry about before.<wait 250> 
I overreacted.
<k>
<p>
So, I've been thinking...
<wait 250>
about your tough decision...
<wait 500>
and here's what I decided.
<k>
<p>
This is the first time you've
ever faced your deep fears.
<wait 250>
...And I'm going to support you.
<k>
<p>
I won't hold you back!
<wait 500>
Good luck, sweet Koops!
<wait 250>
I love you! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0>

<wait 250>
You take care of my Koops.<wait 250>

<k> stg1_nok_69 I'll be here, waiting for
your safe return, Koops.
<wait 250>
Good luck, love!
<k> stg1_nok_70 I'm so sorry about before.
<wait 250>
Please look after Koops.
<k> stg1_nok_71 Do your best, dear Koops!<wait 250> 
I'll be waiting for you.
<k> stg1_nok_72 Take care of Koops, please.
<k> stg1_nok_73 Koops!<wait 50> I know you can do it!<wait 250> 
Prove yourself and then
hurry home to me.
<k> stg1_nok_74 I hope Koops is doing well.<wait 250> 
I'm awfully worried...
<k> stg1_nok_75 I hope you're not causing
everyone problems, Koops.
<wait 250>
Be strong, my love!
<k>
 stg1_nok_76 I hope Koops isn't causing
everyone problems...
<wait 250>
I'm awfully worried...
<k>
 stg1_nok_77 Is it me, Koops, or are you
more...<wait 250>toned than before?
<k>
<p>
Well, well, well, well...
<wait 250>
You'll grow out of that shell
soon if you aren't careful... <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k> stg1_nok_78 Oh, my sweet Koops...<wait 250> 
I wonder if he's forgotten
me on his big adventure?
<k>
<p>
Men are so unpredictable...
<wait 250>
Still, I'm sure our love grows
stronger with distance. <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k> stg1_nok_78_01 Oh, my sweet Koops...<wait 250> 
I wonder if he's forgotten
me on his big adventure?
<k>
<p>
Men are so unpredictable...
<wait 250>
Still, I'm sure our love grows
stronger with distance. <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k> stg1_nok_79 No matter where it is you
go, Son, just know that your
old Koopa's rooting for you!
<k> stg1_nok_80 Take care of young Koops,
will you, Mario?
<k>
<p>
I'm looking forward to the
day my boy comes home a
full-grown Koopa!
<k> stg1_nok_81 Looks like you're working
hard, Koops. <wait 50>Good for you!
<wait 250>
Don't push too hard, though.
<k>
<p>
If you do, you may find
yourself all gobbled up...
<wait 250>
Like me!<wait 50> Yar har har har!
<k> stg1_nok_82 So tell me, Mario, how's
my boy, Koops, doing?
<k>
<p>
If he's not pulling his weight,
you just let me know.
<k>
<p>
I'll take his place in your
group like THAT!<wait 50> Oh, yeah!
<wait 250>
Yar har har har har har!
<k> stg1_nok_83 OK, Koops, it's time for
me to teach you my own
patented fighting technique!
<k>
<p>
If you can master this skill,
you'll be ready for any foe!
<wait 250>
I like to call it the...
<k>
<p>
Power Shell!<wait 400> Hm? <wait 50>You already
know it?<wait 250> Hmmm... <wait 250>So kids grow
even without their parents...
<k> stg1_nok_84 Mario, don't let Koops know,
but I have this dream.
<k>
<p>
Are you ready for it?
<wait 250>
Someday...<wait 250>I want to go on an
adventure with Koops!
<k>
<p>
I get the feeling that day's
not too far off, somehow.
<wait 250>
That's two I owe you, Mario!
<k> stg1_nok_84_1 Well, hello there, Mario!
<wait 250>
Sooo... <wait 250>How are things today?
<k>
<p>
Things are just great here...<wait 50> 
thanks to you!
<k> stg1_nok_85 Koops, my lad...
<wait 250>
Are you telling me that
you're going with Mario?
<k> stg1_nok_86 Umm...<wait 250> That's right, Dad...
<wait 250>
I'm going to continue
traveling with Mario.
<k>
<p>
And then I'm...<wait 250> Well...
<wait 250>
I'm going to come back a
strong Koopa like you, Dad!
<k> stg1_nok_87 Nicely said, young Koops!<wait 250> 
THAT'S my boy!
<k>
<p>
But always remember this:
<wait 500>
you are my son, Koops...
<wait 500>
and I am your father!
<k> stg1_nok_88 Koops, my sweet...
<wait 500>
I'll be right here waiting...
<wait 250>
for you to prove yourself.
<k> stg1_nok_89 Ahem... <wait 250>May I just add...
<wait 500>
If anything happens, you can
always come home, Koops.
<k>
<p>
Don't you ever forget that.
<wait 250>
This village will always be
your home.
<k> stg1_nok_90 OK! <wait 50>Thank you, everyone.
<wait 250>
Well, I'm off!
<k> stg1_nok_91 Sorry to keep you waiting,
Mario.<wait 250> You know...<wait 250>farewells.
<wait 500>
So, where are we going?
<k> stg1_nok_92 Let's head back to
Rogueport.
<k> stg1_nok_94 Remember, Mario?
<k>
<p>
"The bearer of the Magical
Map shall unfurl it before
the Thousand-Year Door."
<k>
<p>
"When this is done, the stars
shall guide the bearer to the
Crystal Star with pure light."
<k>
<p>
And it didn't stop there...
<k>
<p>
"Each Crystal Star shall point
to the next..."
<wait 750>
That's what the books say.
<k>
<p>
Which means...<wait 250>if we take the
Crystal Star we found back
to the Thousand-Year Door...
<k> stg1_nok_95 So...<wait 250>that means the location
of the next Crystal Star will
appear on that magic map?
<k> stg1_nok_96 Exactly!<wait 250> C'mon!<wait 50> Let's go!!
<k> nok_01_aed_nok_01 Mario!<wait 250> I'm so glad I got to
see you again!
<k> nok_01_aed_nok_02 So, you're off on another
adventure, eh?<wait 250> Yes, of
course I'll go with you!
<k> nok_01_aed_nok_03 <system>
Koops has joined your party!
<k> nok_01_aed_nok_04 Come on! Let's go!
<k> irai_08_001 Well, well...<wait 100> Murphy!
<wait 250>
You must have gotten my
request.<wait 250> Good, good.
<k>
<p>
Truth be told, I've been
a touch lonely here with
no one to talk to.
<k>
<p>
Since you're here, why don't
you relax with me for a bit.
<wait 250>
Indulge an old Koopa.
<k>
<p>
Hoo... <wait 100>To tell you the truth,
I've got a few things to say
about kids these days.
<k>
<p>
Their tempers are too short
for their own good, for one!
<wait 250>
Makes me want to smack 'em!
<k>
<p>
Why, I was shopping at the
Toadstool Bros. Discount
Super Shop the other day...
<k>
<p>
I was trying to pay, and my
coin purse was stuck closed,
and the kid behind me said...
<k>
<p>
"Hey, geezer, wanna pay so
we can get out of here
before the sun goes down?"
<k>
<p>
Now, I may be a geezer, but
sundown was clearly taking
longer than I was.<wait 100> Clearly!
<k>
<p>
...Speaking of sundown reminds
me of dating the missus back
before she was the missus.
<k>
<p>
Always had to have her home
by sundown, yessir. <wait 100>Her pa
was an absolute maniac.
<k>
<p>
Yep, I'd keep my eyes on the
sun and off the face of my
missus. <wait 250>Gentlemanly, eh?
<k>
<p>
Actually, it was sort of
awkward. <wait 100>Kind of blinding,
in a painful sort of way.
<k>
<p>
Heh! <wait 100>Just thinking about it
makes me feel awkward!<wait 100> Heh!
<wait 250>
Isn't memory grand?
<k>
<p>
But that's not what I was
talking about.<wait 250> Now where
was I? <wait 100>Hrrrrrmmmm...
<k>
<p>
Oh!<wait 50> That's right!<wait 100> Kids today!
<wait 250>
They know nothing about
patience, I tell you!
<k>
<p>
I want to stand up and yell:
<wait 50>
"HEY!<wait 100> YOU PUNKS!<wait 100> BE MORE
PATIENT!<wait 100> RIGHT NOW!"
<k>
<p>
Speaking of which, I think
I proclaimed my love for
the missus in a loud voice...
<k>
<p>
Yup!<wait 100> She was leaving on a
train, and I yelled it from
the platform! <wait 100>Like in a movie!
<k>
<p>
Now, err...<wait 100> What was it that
I yelled to her? <wait 100>Something
about her shell, maybe...
<k>
<p>
...Oh. <wait 250>Wait.<wait 250> I think I've
strayed from my main point
again...<wait 250> Or wait...<wait 100>did I?
<k>
<p>
Anyhow, me and the missus
were madly in love! <wait 100>Head
over shells, I tell you!
<k>
<p>
No... <wait 250>Wait, my point was
something about kids today,
right?<wait 250> Awwww, whatever...
<k>
<p>
Oh, my dear, sweet missus!
<wait 100>
The way you combed my
eyebrows! <wait 100>Such tenderness!
<k>
<p>
...Huzzuh? <wait 250>Oh, sorry!<wait 100> I got
distracted, there.<wait 100> Anyway,
you get my point.
<k>
<p>
Sorry you had to listen
through all that. <wait 100>Wasn't too
boring though, I'd wager.
<k>
<p>
I'm just happy to get a
little face time with the
youth of today!
<k> irai_08_002 Oops!<wait 250> I forgot to set out
the tea! <wait 250>Aren't I an old
ninny? <wait 250>My apologies.
<k>
<p>
In fact, I haven't even
added the hot water part.
<wait 250>
Awful sorry.
<k>
<o> irai_08_003_1 <p>
...At least I THOUGHT you
could, but it looks like you
can't carry anything else.
<k>
<p>
I'll leave it here for you,
so you can come get it
anytime you like, OK?
<k> irai_08_004 Yeah, boy, if you cook a
Turtley Leaf, you can
make some amazing tea...
<k>
<p>
Oh, and if you change your
mind, you can come back and
listen to me yap anytime.
<k> irai_14_00 Yes, hello, I'm Toce T.<wait 250> 
Did you need something?
<k>
<p>
What? <wait 250>You want to make a
Heartful Cake? <wait 250>And who
asked you to? <wait 250>Merlee?
<k>
<p>
Let's see, I know you need
Cake Mix and Ruin Powder...
<k>
<p>
Tee hee hee! <wait 250>I wonder who
Merlee is making it for
this time...
<k> irai_14_01 You need Cake Mix and 
Ruin Powder to make
a Heartful Cake.
<k>
<p>
Say "hi" to Merlee for me!
<k> irai_17_00 Murphy! <wait 250>What can I do for
you, young man?
<k> irai_17_01 Eh?<wait 250> The Silver Club approval
slip? <wait 250>Is that from the Puni
elder? <wait 250>That old so-and-so...
<k>
<p>
That reminds me, that Super
Blood Pressure Gauge I
borrowed from her was great!
<k>
<p>
Since I'm the last one to sign
this, it just needs to go back
to Twilight Town's mayor.
<k>
<p>
<shake>Haaack! <wait 250>Kack!<wait 250> Pitooey!</shake><wait 250> 
But...<wait 250>I seem to have caught
a bit of a cold.
<k>
<p>
Could you take it to the
Twilight Town mayor? <wait 250>Thanks,
Murphy!<wait 250> <shake>Haack! Kack!</shake>
<k> irai_17_02 Please return the approval
form to Twilight Town's mayor.
<wait 250>
OK, Murphy?<wait 250> <shake>Haack! <wait 250>Kack!</shake> 
<k> stg8_dark_01 Uh...<wait 250> Er...<wait 250> Whuh...<wait 250> Hmmm...<wait 250> Umm...
<wait 250>
Wh-What's going on?
<k> stg8_las_148_03 Hmmm, now?
<k> stg8_las_148_04 What's this shiny thing?
<k> stg8_las_148_05 Mayor!<wait 250> It's the Crystal Star!
<k>
<p>
But I thought Mario had
this thing...
<k> stg8_las_148_06 ...
<k>
<p>
I wonder, kids, if this is
related to the sky getting
all dark and whatnot...
<k> stg8_las_148_07 Hmmm...<wait 250> You may be right,
but I don't know.
<k>
<p>
But if anything's happened
to my boy Koops and Mario...
<k> stg8_las_148_08 <dynamic 3>
Oh, dear...
</dynamic><k> stg8_las_148_09 Koops... <wait 250>You're OK, right?
<wait 250>
You promised me you'd come
back OK...
<k> ep_38 <housou>
Koops is living peacefully in
Petalburg with his dad and
Koopie Koo.
<k>
<p>
And, Mario...<wait 250> Guess what
Koops wants to do now!
<k>
<p>
He wants to become mayor
of Petalburg and live there
in peace!<wait 250> Can you imagine?
<k>
<p>
Still, it might just be perfect
for him, come to think of it.
<k>
<p>
He's so much more of an
adult now than when you
left Rogueport!
<k>
<p>
...Still, I think Koopie Koo
pretty much has him wrapped
around her little finger!
<k> ep_39 <housou>
Flurrie's back on stage in
a big way, and the crowds
are totally ecstatic.
<k>
<p>
And, the play she's doing
right now is the story of
our adventure! <wait 250>Yeah!
<k>
<p>
It's called "Paper Mario"!
I saw it twice! <wait 250>It was totally
the best play ever!
<k>
<p>
And somehow, Doopliss has
joined the troupe as an
actor!<wait 250> Who saw that coming?
<k>
<p>
His transformation skills
are serving him well, but it
still kind of creeps me out...
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is Petalburg.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
The warm weather makes the
locals laid-back and happy.
<k>
<p>
Wow, and talk about unique
personalities...
<k>
<p>
Very...<wait 250>individualistic, to put
it nicely.<wait 300> Or, not so nicely...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
<dynamic 3>Downright kooky</dynamic>...
<k> ƒmƒRƒmƒRG <keyxon>
That's a Bub-ulb, a talking
flower. <dkey><wait 300></dkey>I think he lives in
Petalburg.
<k>
<p>
I know he's a plant, but he
makes more sense than these
other crazy Petalburgers!
<k> ƒmƒRƒmƒRH <keyxon>
That's a Petalburg Koopa.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He always seems to be
worried about something.
<k>
<p>
It's weird, too, 'cause
the rest of this town is
so laid-back, y'know?
<k> ƒmƒRƒmƒRI <keyxon>
That's a Toad from Petalburg.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He just seems like a regular
Toad to me...
<k>
<p>
But I hear he leads a secret
life as president of the
Luigi Fan Club!
<k> ƒmƒRƒmƒRK <keyxon>
That's Toce T., a Toad from
Petalburg.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> She seems really
huffy about something.
<k>
<p>
She sure does keep a
straight face, though.<wait 300> I guess
she's a pretty tough cookie...
<k> ‘º’· <keyxon>
That's Kroop, the mayor of
Petalburg.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He just babbles,
whether he's alone or not.
<k>
<p>
I just can't tell if he's really
senile, or if he's just working
that angle, y'know?
<k> –å”ÔƒmƒRƒmƒR <keyxon>
That's the gatekeeper of
Petalburg.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He's super-dutiful
about guarding this gate.
<k>
<p>
But I bet he'd totally run
for cover if real monsters
ever did show up here...
<k>
<p>
I just get a feeling about him.
<wait 300>
Goomba's intuition, maybe?
<k> ƒmƒRƒ^ƒƒE <keyxon>
That's Koops, from Petalburg.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's got confidence issues...
<wait 300>
He's a...<wait 250>cringer, y'know?
<k>
<p>
But he's definitely got a
serious interest in Hooktail...
<wait 300>
I wonder why?
<k> ƒmƒRƒ^ƒƒE•ƒ <keyxon>
That's Koops's dad, Koopley.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He seems kind of out of it.
<wait 300>
Are all Koopas space cadets?
<k>
<p>
Then again, Koops is really
with it... <wait 250>Maybe that's 'cause
his dad is like this...
<k>
<p>
Anyway, Koopley does worry
about Koops a lot,<wait 300> so I guess
he's a good dad after all.
<k> ƒmƒRƒŠƒ“ <keyxon>
That's Koopie Koo, a local
Petalburger.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> She seems to be
Koops's girlfriend.
<k>
<p>
Gosh, she's really cute...and
she seems to have a good
head on her, too.
<k>
<p>
Thing is, because she's smart,
she kinda mothers Koops a
little bit...
<k>
<p>
I guess it's a complicated
relationship.<wait 250> But then again,
what relationship isn't?
<k> —x‚èŽq‚P <keyxon>
These are the Traveling
Sisters 3.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> They seem to go
everywhere together.
<k>
<p>
They seem so ditzy, though.
<wait 250>
Do they even notice each
new place they wind up in?
<k> —x‚èŽq‚Q <keyxon>
These are the Traveling

Sounds nice.<wait 250> Y'know, traveling.
<wait 300>
I wish I had time to travel
with friends from school...
<k>  

stg6_pik_00 We have a bit of time until
our next departure.
<k> stg6_pik_01 You wouldn't happen to have
a train set for sale, would
you? <wait 250>A gold one, perhaps?
<k> stg6_pik_02 We'd dearly like to find a
suitable present for little Bub.
<k> stg6_pik_03 Hey, Mister.<wait 250> I'm gonna get a
train set! <wait 250>The coolest one
ever invented!
<k>
<p>
I could just have them buy
me a real train, but maybe I'll
save that for next year!
<k> stg6_pik_04 Welcome, you marvelous man.
<wait 250>
The train journey certainly
was thrilling, hmmm?
<k> stg6_pik_04_01 Well, hello there, you tousled,
hairy yeti of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're glorious, dear.
<k>
<p>
Of course I remember you.
<wait 250>
Who could forget all your
heroic deeds on the train?
<k>
<p>
In fact, a strong young man
like you could really help me.
<wait 250>
Will you hear my request?
<o> stg6_pik_04_02 <p>
Ah, how simply wonderful!
<k>
<p>
Now listen, and listen well...
<k>
<p>
I want you to look for the
Gold Ring that I've lost.
<k>
<p>
Please,<wait 250> you sly, superb sleuth
of a man, you!
<k> stg6_pik_04_03 <p>
Oh, that IS inconvenient!
<wait 250>
And I truly thought you
would listen to me...
<k> stg6_pik_04_04 Well, hello there, you fiery,
flashy frappe of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're magnificent, dear.
<k>
<p>
I don't suppose...<wait 250>you would
be willing to help me with
that little thing now?
<o> stg6_pik_04_05 <select 0 1 0 40>
Sure, why not?
Sorry, maybe later. stg6_pik_04_06 Why, have you already found
my Gold Ring?
<k> stg6_pik_04_07 Yes.<wait 250> That is definitely
the ring I lost.
<k>
<p>
Thank you, you glorious
creature.<wait 250> I knew you would
find it, without fail.
<k>
<p>
It is merely a trifle, but
please take this as my
earnest thanks. stg6_pik_04_08 And farewell.
<k> stg6_pik_04_10 I see...
<k> stg6_pik_05 The business people I'm
waiting for haven't arrived
yet, so I'm sightseeing.
<k>
<p>
On the expense account, of
course. <wait 250>As if you have to
ask by now.
<k> stg7_pik_clear_01 Well, hello there, you super-
ultra-hero of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're splendid, dear.
<k> stg7_pik_clear_01_1 Well, hello there, you svelte,
sleek plumber of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're ravishing, dear.
<k> train_00 This train is bound for
Rogueport.<wait 250> Would you like to
board at this time, sir?
<o> train_01 <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No train_02 <p>
We look forward to serving
you later, then!
<k> train_03 <p>
If I may, let me just check
your ticket...
<k> train_04 Very good, sir.<wait 250> Please watch
your step.
<k> train_05 I'm very sorry, but we simply
cannot let anyone board
without a ticket.
<k> train_06 There is still some time
before the next departure.
<k> train_07 All aboard!
<k> stg7_pik_01 Good day to you, Gonzales.
<wait 250>
What can I do for you today?
<k> stg7_pik_02 What's that you say?<wait 250> You
must use the cannon in Fahr
Outpost to save the world?
<k>
<p>
Hmmm...<wait 250> Well, that IS rather a
pickle, isn't it?
<k> stg7_pik_03 Very well, then!<wait 250> I certainly
owe you a favor or two, hm?
<wait 250>
Yes, I should say!
<k>
<p>
The truth is, I had hoped to
resume my business with that
cannon someday...
<k>
<p>
And just between us...<wait 250>I only
stopped because the wife
said she didn't like the noise.
<k> stg7_pik_04 Sadly, it takes a hefty bit of
coin to get that cannon
working...<wait 250> So...
<k>
<p>
I'll need you to demonstrate
just how much you want to
use that cannon.
<k>
<p>
If it were a matter of money,
just how much would you
pay, if I may ask?
<o> stg7_pik_04_yn <select 0 -1 0 80>
Nothing.
1 coin.
64 coins.
Everything I have! stg7_pik_05 Oh, you're back, are you?
<wait 250>
I thought you might be.
<wait 250>
Let's ask one more time.
<k>
<p>
How much would you pay to
use the cannon?<wait 250> I just need
to see how serious you are...
<o> stg7_pik_06 <p>
So you're not serious, then?
<wait 250>
Well, I understand.
<k> stg7_pik_07 <p>
You don't seem to have any
coins at all.<wait 250> How utterly
preposterous, my lad.
<k>
<p>
Well that won't do, no, no.
<wait 250>
Why don't you return later
with some money, hm?
<k> stg7_pik_08 <p>
Something for nothing? <wait 250>Ha!
<wait 250>
Money makes the world spin!
<wait 250>
You're a bit naive, I'm afraid.
<k>
<p>
Why don't you come back
once you learn a bit about
the way of the world, hm?
<k> stg7_pik_09 <p>
One coin?<wait 250> Do you mock me?
<wait 250>
Why not just slap me with
your shoe and be done?!?
<k>
<p>
This will not do, no, no.
<wait 250>
Why don't you come back
later, with a new attitude.
<k> stg7_pik_10 <p>
64 coins!<wait 250> You seem to be
underestimating the value
of my services.
<k>
<p>
Well, I just can't abide that.
<wait 250>
Why don't you come back
later, hm?
<k> stg7_pik_11 <p>
What?<wait 250> You'd pay every coin
you own? <wait 250>All of them?
<k>
<p>
You, er...<wait 250> Really?
<wait 250>
So... <wait 250>Really?
<o> stg7_pik_11_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No stg7_pik_12 <p>
Well, I suppose I'm just
surprised to hear you say
that.<wait 250> Staggered, actually.
<k>
<p>
You know that means you'll
be left with zero coins?
<wait 250>
With absolutely nothing?
<k>
<p>
You know that, do you?
<o> stg7_pik_13 <p>
I mean, think of it, man!
<wait 250>
If you spent all your coins...
<wait 250>
and I mean ALL of them...
<k>
<p>
You would certainly face a
great deal of difficulty
down the road.
<o> stg7_pik_14 <p>
But hold on.<wait 250> I want to make
sure you're doing this fully
aware of the consequences.
<k>
<p>
Are you sure you won't regret
this later? <wait 250>Absolutely sure?
<o> stg7_pik_15 <p>
I can really take them all?
<wait 250>
Really?
<k>
<p>
You won't say "Just kidding!"
later on or any sort of
tomfoolery like that?
<o> stg7_pik_16 <p>
Well, all right then...
<k> stg7_pik_17 Hmm...<wait 250> Well, you've certainly
shown me something, sir.
<k>
<p>
So...<wait 250> I give my permission
for you to activate the
Fahr Outpost cannon.
<k> stg7_pik_18 Oh...<wait 250> And I wasn't serious
earlier, my dear fellow.
<k>
<p>
How could I take your money?
<wait 250>
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha!
<k>
<p>
<scale 0.5>
It's a shame, I suppose...
</scale>
but I'll return your money.
<k> stg7_pik_19 Now soldier on, my boy!
<k> stg7_pik_19_01 Have you been giving it your
all, my boy?
<k> stg7_pik_19_01_1 Can you believe there are
no train sets for sale in
this horrid place?!?
<k>
<p>
I suppose I'll just have to
build a train-set store to
sell me one for my son!
<k> stg7_pik_19_01_2 Can you believe there are
no train sets for sale in

<k> stg7_pik_20 You know, Gonzales...

There are ways to express
oneself besides money...
<k> stg7_pik_21 Gonzales, I think you are
simply the best.
<k> stg7_pik_21_1 Little Bub didn't get a
thing for his birthday!
<k>
<p>
We'll just have to double

No, wait!!

<wait 250>
I can go, right?
<k> stg7_pik_23 You're pretty cool, Mister.
<k> stg7_pik_23_1 Dad says there's no train-set

<k> irai_23_00 So, you accepted my request
for aid with my little trouble,
<wait 250>
you delightful man, you!
<k>
<p>
I just decided I very much
want to read a magazine I
lent to Jolene.
<k>
<p>
But she lives in Glitzville.
<wait 250>
And that is very far from
here, as you know.
<k>
<p>
Could you go get it for me,
you resourceful wizard, you?
<k>
<p>
You're fabulous, dear.
<k> irai_23_01 Did you get the magazine
from Jolene, you wonderful
man, you?
<k> irai_23_02 Yes, this is the magazine I
lent to Jolene, all right.<wait 250> You
are a true hero! <wait 250>Thank you!
<k>
<p>
Here is my thanks to you.
<k> irai_23_03 This magazine is very popular
among certain celebrities.
<k>
<p>
Everyone who is anyone has
been spotted in a cafe with
it under one arm.
<k> irai_25_00 So, Gonzales!<wait 250> How did you
enjoy your cannon ride, hm?
<k>
<p>
I'd like to go to the moon and
look for some investment
opportunities...
<k>
<p>
But enough of that.<wait 250> I need
you to take this to General
White immediately.
<k> irai_25_01 I think General White is back
in Fahr Outpost now.<wait 250> It's a bit
far, but you can handle it.
<k> irai_25_02 I think General White is back
in Fahr Outpost now.<wait 250> It's a bit
far, but you can handle it.
<k> irai_25_03 Ah, Gonzales!<wait 250> General White
was just here a moment ago!
<k>
<p>
But you had the thing I
wanted to give him! <wait 250>What a
rotten bit of luck!
<k>
<p>
He said he was headed back
to Fahr Outpost...
<k>
<p>
That General White is a fine
Bob-omb, but he does tend
to wander...
<k>
<p>
And...<wait 250> Once he's asleep,
it's near impossible to wake
him, don't you know!
<k>
<p>
I told him to stay out and
awake, so get over to Fahr
Outpost!<wait 250> Sorry about that!
<k> irai_25_04 Did you find General White?
<k>
<p>
I see.<wait 250> And he received it?
<wait 250>
...Good.<wait 250> Thanks, Gonzales!
<k>
<p>
Here is your reward.
<k> irai_29_14 Why hello, Gonzales.
<wait 250>
Do you need something?
<k> irai_29_15 From little Bub, you say?
<wait 250>
...Why, there's a letter!
<wait 250>
Let me just read it...
<k>
<p>
"Dear lovely Mama...
<wait 250>
I'm sorry I didn't do my
homework.
<k>
<p>
"From now on, I'll do my
homework and try to be a
good Bob-omb like Papa.
<k>
<p>
"And I will give you good
food and a nice house...
<k>
<p>
"...and a pretty hat.
<k>
<p>
"So please don't hate me.
<wait 250>
From Bub."
<k>
<p>
.....................................................................
................Oh, I'm just going to
break down and cry, here!
<k>
 irai_29_16 Ohhh...<wait 250> How delightful!
<k>
<p>
WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!
<wait 250>
WAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUGH!
<k> irai_29_17 Oh, Gonzales, don't mind my
tears; they are joyful ones.
<k>
<p>
I just want you to tell Bub
something for me.
<k>
<p>
Tell him I'm not angry.
<k>
<p>
I was just being stern
because I love him and care
about his future.
<k>
<p>
I never meant to hurt his
little feelings by it!
<k>
<p>
And I'm sorry I lost sight
of that...
<k>
<p>
Gonzales,<wait 250> please bring my
little Bub back to me now...
<k>
 irai_29_18 I'm just so very touched...
<wait 250>
Please tell Bub how I feel.
<k> irai_29_18_1 It seems Bub and the missus
had a little row, hm?
<k>
<p>
It's hard when they get to
that rebellious age, you
know, dear boy?
<k> irai_29_18_2 Hm? <wait 250>Bub?
<k>
<p>
...................................
<k>

Who's that?<wait 250> I know no Bub...
<wait 250>

Station. <dkey><wait 300></dkey>The Excess Express

<p>
This place is sooooo upscale.
<wait 250>

of Rogueport.

You can tell that movie stars
and millionaires live here.
<wait 250>
It just REEKS of cash.

That's a Poshley Heights
Station worker.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He mostly

work in totally nice places.
<wait 300>
They even see movie stars...
<k> サラリーマン <keyxon>
That's the Ratooey
businessman who was on the
Excess Express.

everything on his expense
account.<wait 300> SKETCHY!
<k> ナリキンママ <keyxon>

air around her...<wait 300> Even her
perfume smells like money.
<k> ナリキンパパ <keyxon>
That's Goldbob the Bob-omb.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's the head of a wealthy
business, Goldbobbington's.
<k>
<p>
He's got buckets of ducats,
they say.<wait 300> I guess some folks
are just good with money!
<k> コナリキン <keyxon>
That's Bub the Bob-omb.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's from a very rich family,
so he's kind of spoiled.
<k>
<p>
Still, kids are kids, no
matter how big their trust
fund is...<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Aren't they?
<k> マダム <keyxon>
That's Toodles the Toad.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Gosh, that woman is so
fashionable it makes me sick!

She's obviously the kind of
lady that belongs around
here.<wait 250> Classy all the way!

Mario found the sixth Crystal
Star, hidden craftily in the
Poshley Heights sanctum.
<k>
<p>
Now only one Crystal Star
remains...

But our hero still does not
know where Princess Peach is
being held.

<p>

Star be?<wait 300> And where is Peach
being held?

Well, whatever... <wait 250>This must be

In my travels, I heard a
rumor that Lord Crump and
Grodus were both still alive.
<k>
<p>
I guess that makes them
pretty tenacious baddies,

<p>
But they've mellowed a lot,
just like Beldam has, and I
don't expect more trouble.

a head, which really cuts
down on mischief-making.

<k> stg6_rsh_c_08_1 How was your trip, sir?

The Excess Express is
<wait 250>
fabulous, is it not?
</wave>
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is the engineer's car of
the Excess Express.<wait 250> Any kid
would LOVE to see this!
<k>
<p>
Look at me, Mario! <wait 250>I'm an
engineer! <wait 250>WOOP WOOOOOP!
<k>
<p>
Hey, but driving a train is
really nothing to joke about.
<wait 300>
I totally respect engineers!
<k> ‰^“]Žè <keyxon>
That's the engineer of the
Excess Express.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Talk about a
dream job for kids!
<k>
<p>
But just saying you drive a
train doesn't make you cool.
<wait 250>
You gotta LOVE the job!
<k>
<p>
I mean, we're talking about
a train, here. <wait 250>That's some
serious responsibility!
<k>  

stg6_rsh_09 Hey, guy.<wait 250> Yeah, you know this,
but I'm the absurdly famous
movie star, Zip Toad.
<k>
<p>
I'm gonna shoot this little
multibillion-dollar art
flick in Poshley Heights, yo.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and, uh, I only sign
autographs for cute chicks.
<wait 250>
Sorry about that, guy.
<k> stg6_rsh_10 Hey, guy.<wait 250> Yeah, you know this,

<k>
<p>
Oh, and, uh, I only sign
autographs for cute chicks.
<wait 250>
Sorry about that, guy.
<k> stg6_rsh_11 Well, hello there, you ducky,
debonair dish of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're smashing, dear.
<k>
<p>
What's this?<wait 250> A witch?
<k>
<p>
Well, people have certainly
said that I'm possessed of
an enchanting aura...
<k>
<p>
But you're the first person
to remark so boldly on my
bewitching beauty, dear...
<k> stg6_rsh_53 Is there some sort of hoopla
going on outside?
<k>
<p>
Hm? <wait 250>The stewpot, you say?
<k>
<p>
Ooh, stew?<wait 250> No, no, far too
rich for me, my dear.<wait 250> I'm on
a low-carb diet...
<k> stg6_rsh_61 Hey, guy.<wait 250> Getting falsely
accused is a bummer, right?
<wait 250>
Don't I know it!
<k> stg6_rsh_62 Well, hello there, you sweet,
savage sleuth of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're spectacular, dear.
<k> stg6_rsh_80 Well, hello there, you fine,
fine specimen of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're marvelous, dear.
<k>
<p>
You solved a rather tough
little mystery, didn't you?
<wait 250>
Yes, VERY well done.
<k>
<p>
<wave>
You're so ruggedly smart...
</wave>
<k>
<p>
Perhaps you could help me
with something, as well?
<o> stg6_rsh_81 <p>
Oh, how absolutely lovely!
<k>
<p>
Now, listen well...
<k>
<p>
I'm looking for a Gold Ring
that I lost somewhere on this
very train.
<k>
<p>
Could you please hasten the
search along for me...<wait 250>you
boldly brilliant man, you?
<k> stg6_rsh_82 <p>
That's rather disappointing...
<wait 250>
I was sure you would help me
with this...
<k> stg6_rsh_83 Well, hello there, you nice,
noble prince of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're a hero, dear.
<k>
<p>
I don't suppose...<wait 250>you've
changed your mind about
helping me?
<o> stg6_rsh_83_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
I'll help.
Sorry. stg6_rsh_84 You'll help me find my gold
ring?<wait 250> Oh, thanks ever so!
<k> stg6_rsh_106 What does that little Bub kid
want as a present?
<wait 250>
Uh............................................
<k>
<p>
Well, I'm sure he'd be
stoked to have an autograph
of mine, right, guy?
<k>
<p>
Oh, man, don't they all?
<wait 250>
I can't do it, unfortunately.
<wait 250>
I only sign for chicks.
<k> stg6_rsh_107_0 Hey...
<k>
<p>
You don't think Bub might
want something from someone
he admires, do you?
<k>
<p>
Well, we'd better find
whatever it is soon, or we'll
meet a yummy, sticky end!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_1 Say...
<k>
<p>
You don't suppose that Bub
wants something from a
person he admires?
<k>
<p>
Whatever it is, we have to
find it quickly or we'll
end up yummy and sticky!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_2 Hey, Gonzales!
<k>
<p>
You think that Bub kid might
want something from a guy
he admires, maybe?
<k>
<p>
Whatever he wants, we gotta
find it soon or else BOOM!
<wait 250>
Yummy and sticky!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_3 Mario, darling...
<k>
<p>
Don't you think perhaps the
young child wants something
from someone he admires?
<k>
<p>
Whatever it is he craves,
we must find it before the
train goes yummy and sticky!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_4 Uh, Mario...
<k>
<p>
Is there any chance Bub
wants something from a
person he admires?
<k>
<p>
Well, whatever it is, we'd
better find it before we
meet a yummy, sticky end!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_5 I say, old boy...
<k>
<p>
Might this Bub tyke merely
want something from someone
he admires?
<k>
<p>
Whatever he craves, we'd
best find it soon, old boy!
<wait 250>
The train is in danger!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_6 Hmmmm...
<k>
<p>
Perhaps that young Bub child
just wants something from
someone he admires...
<k>
<p>
Whatever it is, we must
find it soon!<wait 250> A yummy, sticky
danger is out there!

<o> stg6_rsh_diary_03 <system>

<dkey><wait 400></dkey>
This could be really, REALLY
bad, you understand me?

<k> stg6_rsh_147_02 I'm feeling totally wrung
out, guy.<wait 250> It's hard being
famous, lemme tell you!
<k> stg6_rsh_147_03 Ah, time for my beauty sleep.
<wait 250>
Staying up late causes
wrinkles, you know...
<k> stg6_rsh_160 Well, hello there, you cute,
cuddly bear of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're delightful, dear.
<k>
<p>
Have you found my Gold Ring?
<k>
<p>
Don't grow desperate, now.
<wait 250>
I'm quite sure you'll be
able to find it!
<k> stg6_rsh_200 Have you found my Gold Ring,
you mystery-sniffing master?
<k> stg6_rsh_201 Yes.<wait 250> That is definitely
the ring I lost.
<k>
<p>
Thank you, you glorious
creature.<wait 250> I knew you would
find it, without fail.
<k>
<p>
It is merely a trifle, but
please take this as my
earnest thanks.
<k> stg6_rsh_202 And DO take care.
<k> stg6_rsh_201_2 I see...
<k> stg6_rsh_204 Thank you for this service.
<wait 250>
Would you like to stay and
chat a while?
<k>
 stg6_rsh_205 What sort of business do
you have in Poshley Heights,
if I may ask?
<o> stg6_rsh_205_01 <select 0 1 0 40>
Going to Poshley Sanctum.
Hunting the Crystal Star. stg6_rsh_206 <p>
To Poshley Sanctum, hm?
<wait 250>
There is a very large painting
there, you know.
<k>
<p>
It looks big enough to
swallow one whole, in fact.
<k> stg6_rsh_207 <p>
The Crystal Star? <wait 250>Mmmmm...
<wait 250>
Yes, it is a<wait 250> lovely gem,
is it not?
<k>
<p>
It is displayed in the
Poshley Sanctum, of course,
as you well know.
<k> stg6_rsh_208 I am going to my summer
home in Poshley Heights.
<wait 250>
I must escape the bustle!
<k>
<p>
You should stop in sometime,
you courageous, wonderful
detective, you.
<k>
<p>
Maybe you can tell me all
about your adventures.

<k> stg6_rsh_221 We're finally going to arrive
in Poshley Heights tomorrow.
<wait 250>
About time, I should say.
<k>
<p>
But that is for tomorrow!
<wait 250>
Now it is beauty-sleep time.
<wait 250>
Late nights cause wrinkles!
<k> stg6_rsh_248 Thank you!

<p>
Boy, it's like all you did

<k> stg6_rsh_252 We will soon arrive at
Poshley Heights!
<k>
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen...
<wait 250>
Please prepare to disembark.
<k> stg6_rsh_261 <system>
The door may not be opened
while the train is in motion.
<k> stg6_rsh_262 <system>
There are several postcards
and glossies featuring Zip
Toad inside.
<k> stg6_rsh_263 <system>
There are giant mounds of
cosmetics inside.
<k> stg6_rsh_267 <system>

There's nothing here.
<k> stg6_rsh_c_09_1 Your attention, passengers.
<wait 250>
The train has just arrived

<p>
Please watch your step, and
we hope you join us again
here on the Excess Express!
<k> stg6_rsh_c_14 We still have some time
before we get to Rogueport,
Mr. Mario.
<k>
<p>
Why don't you get some nice
rest in your room?
<k>
<p>
You're staying in cabin 5,
Mr. Mario.
<k> stg6_rsh_c_15 The scenery from a train
window is ever changing,
like the human heart...
<k>
<p>
But some things don't change.
<wait 250>
Like the endless flow of
mushroom dishes here.
<k> stg6_rsh_c_16 Hey.<wait 250> Are you enjoying your
train ride?
<o> stg6_rsh_c_16_sel <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No stg6_rsh_c_16_01 <p>
Once a train voyage is
under way, you can't get off.
<wait 250>
Whether you want to or not.
<k>
<p>
Hey...<wait 250> You're making a face
like you just don't care...
<k> stg6_rsh_c_17 Hey, um...<wait 250> Where's the
bathroom on this train?
<wait 250>
Do you know?
<o> stg6_rsh_c_17_sel <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No stg6_rsh_c_17_01 <p>
I can hold on a little longer,
so I'll keep looking...
<k> stg6_rsh_c_18 Ahh...<wait 250> The rocking of this
train makes me so sleepy.
<k>
<p>
Even just talking to you right
now...<wait 250> I feel myself drifting
off...<wait 250>to dreamland...
<k> stg6_rsh_c_19 I am a professor at
Goombsley University.
<k>
<p>
I am researching the feeding
habits of the wild Smorg...
<wait 250>
But I just cannot find any!
<k>
<p>
You, er...<wait 250> You wouldn't know
where I could find any,
would you?
<k> stg6_rsh_c_20 The beginning of a voyage is
so full of excitement...
<k>
<p>
But the end of a voyage is
always beset by such a
lonely sadness.
<k>
<p>
Excitement then sadness...
<wait 250>
Travel is so much like love
that way...<wait 250> You know?
<k> stg6_rsh_c_21 Hey, Papa!
<k>
<p>
Huh?<wait 250> Whoops!<wait 250> Wrong person!
<wait 250>
Super-sorry about that,
Mr. Mustache-Person!
<k> stg6_rsh_c_22 Here I am again, getting on
this train just to try to
approach the waitress...
<k>
<p>
How many times is this,
I wonder...ÿ
<k>
<p>
At any rate, I've developed
a fondness for trains.
<k>
<p>
That waitress and this train...
<dynamic 3>
I love them both!
</dynamic>
<k> stg6_rsh_c_23 Yeah, I heard Zip Toad
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
was definitely on this train
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
really recently...
<k>
<p>
And yeah, I bought a ticket
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
just to see where he
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
stayed, and maybe ate...
<k>
<p>
And so then I was like,
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
yeah yeah yeah YEAH!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I got my ticket!
<k>
<p>
........................................
<dkey><wait 300></dkey><wave>
But then, the worst thing...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey></wave>
Someone said it was a fake...
<k>
<p>
What a huge bummer...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
A total, stinking bummer...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
You know?
<k>
 stg6_rsh_c_24 BING! <wait 250>BONG!<wait 250> BING!<wait 250> BONG!

I wanna be one right NOW!

cabins here, numbers 1 and 2.

I KNEW I knew him!<wait 250> That's
Zip Toad, the movie star!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Women go NUTS for him!
<k>
<p>
Y'know, he's hot and all,
but he seems pretty stuck
up about being famous.
<k>
<p>
I guess all celebrities are
kinda like that.<wait 300> It's too bad,
'cause I kinda liked him...
<k> ƒ}ƒ_ƒ€ <keyxon>
That's Toodles the Toad.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Gosh, that woman is so
fashionable it makes me sick!
<k>
<p>
She's obviously the kind of
lady that belongs on this
train.<wait 250> Classy all the way!
<k> ŽÔ¶ <keyxon>
That's the conductor of the
Excess Express.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He takes
care of passengers' needs.

engineer's job, y'know.

Don't go to Poshley Heights!
Get off the train now, or a

<wait 250>
You think Beldam has
anything to do with it?

the culprit's on the train!

Ooh, I HATE threats!<wait 250> Let's
get this nutjob before they
try anything!

You don't think that Beldam
put it there, do you?
<k>
<p>
Well, the fact that it
appeared now means the
culprit's on the train!
<k>
<p>
We have to get this weird
threatener before they do
anything sticky or yummy!
<k> stg6_rsh_pro_04_win A threat...<wait 250>a very odd one!
<wait 250>
You don't suppose Beldam is
responsible, do you?

<p>
Well, whoever the culprit
is, they are most assuredly
on this train!

<p>
Let's get this villain before
they try anything!
<k> stg6_rsh_pro_04_yos Whoa! <wait 250>What a freaky threat!
<wait 250>
You don't think this could
be Beldam's work, do you?

Whoever this psycho is, you
gotta figure they're on this
train, right?

<p>
We gotta get this nut!

Before anything bad goes
down on this train!

<wait 250>
Could it be Beldam's work?

My sister IS a weird one...

I won't be able to eat this
amazing Excess Express chow.

<wait 250>
I won't be going anywhere...

We've gotta get that Crystal
Star before those other guys,
no matter what!
<k>
<p>
So, let's rest up so we're
ready for tomorrow, OK?
<k> stg6_rsh_224_1 Finally, we get to Poshley
Heights tomorrow, huh?
<k>
<p>
We have to get the Crystal
Star before those others,

We'd better get some rest
so we're fresh for tomorrow...
<k> stg6_rsh_224_2 Woo hoo! <wait 250>Tomorrow is finally
Poshley Heights day!
<k>
<p>
We've gotta get the Crystal
Star before those other
goons, no matter what!
<k>
<p>
Let's catch some Z's before
the big day, huh?
<k> stg6_rsh_224_3 So, tomorrow we shall see
Poshley Heights at long
last, will we?
<k>
<p>
We simply must get the
Crystal Star before those
others! <wait 250>We MUST!
<k>
<p>
Let's get a wink of beauty
sleep before then, hmm?
<k> stg6_rsh_224_4 Well, sounds like tomorrow

a snooze so we're right

Why, it could even be the
coward who wrote that note!

The sticky, yummy one!

Choo-Choo! ﾘ
<k> stg6_rsh_c_31 The sight of the ocean from
the window of a train is so
very beautiful!
<k>
<p>
I just find myself exclaiming
about its beauty without
even realizing it!
<k> stg6_rsh_c_32 I wonder how long it takes
to just walk from Rogueport
to Poshley Heights...
<k>
<p>
And if a train shaves off time
from your voyage, does that
make it like a time machine?
<k> stg6_rsh_c_33 Which do you prefer, curry
or stew?<wait 250> Sorry, I guess that's
a weird question to ask...
<k>
<p>
Anyway, me, I like curry.
<wait 250>
It took a while, but that's
the conclusion I've come to.
<k> stg6_rsh_c_34 Ka-BLOWIE! <wait 250>Pa-KOWWWW!
<wait 250>
I'm a wild gunman!<wait 250> Yeah, like
a sheriff or somethin'!
<k>
<p>
And I've got Gonzales, the
super-villain, in my sights!
<wait 250>
Freeze, sucka!<wait 250> Ka-POW!
<k> stg6_rsh_c_35 Everyone here seems happy,
but travel is not all fun
and games, is it?
<k>
<p>
Sometimes you get sick or
pickpocketed, or worse!
<k> stg6_rsh_c_36 Ugh...<wait 250> Why do I have to travel
for work and get shook on
every plane, train, and boat!
<k>
<p>
I should be at home with my
new bride!<wait 250> I need to get back
home!<wait 250> Oh!<wait 250> My lovely wife!
<k> stg6_rsh_c_37 You think all my people back
home worry about me while
I'm off traveling?
<k>
<p>
It always freaks me out to
think that I might get in
an accident and scare them.
<k>
<p>
Think about it: accidents
happen. <wait 250>And you're telling
me you still like to travel?
<o> stg6_rsh_c_37_sel <select 0 1 0 40>
Get over it!
I hate travel. stg6_rsh_c_37_01 <p>
You travel at the risk of
your life, sir!
<k> stg6_rsh_c_38 I'm a pretty serious guy.
<wait 250>
But I think I've fallen for
the waitress here...
<k>
<p>
What should I do?<wait 250> They never
teach you the answer to
that question in school...
<k> stg6_rsh_c_39 I just want to stay on this
train forever...<wait 250> What sort of
magic's possessed me?
<k> stg6_rsh_c_40 Ugh...<wait 250> This is the worst.
<k>
<p>
Double ugh...<wait 250> Business trips,
I tell ya.
<k>
<p>
Those angry stares from my
wife and daughter...<wait 250> Yikes.
<wait 250>
But Dad's gotta work!
<k> stg6_rsh_c_41 Whenever I face anything
sad or hard...<wait 250>I just want
to get far away.
<k>
<p>
Now, why is that?<wait 250> Is it
because time and distance
solve all problems?
<k>
<p>
Do we want to put the hard
things far away and behind
us, like yesterday's sunset?
<k>
<p>
Hey, that was a pretty cool
line, right?<wait 250> I think I'm
going to use it in a novel.
<k> stg6_rsh_c_42 I'm an expert traveler.
<wait 250>
Wanna know the three
secrets to a good journey?
<o> stg6_rsh_c_42_sel <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No stg6_rsh_c_42_01 <p>
Here we go... <wait 250>Number one!
<wait 250>
Leave the ordinary behind!
<wait 250>
That includes the cell phone!
<k>
<p>
Number two!<wait 250> Try to see
farther than usual.<wait 250> And I'm
not just talking scenery...
<k>
<p>
Number three!<wait 250> Shop after
five for saver specials!
<wait 250>
Deals come out at night!
<k>
<p>
Wait, no, that's the promotion
at the local supermarket...
<wait 250>
Yeah, sorry about that.
<k>
<p>
But, hey, there you have it.
<wait 250>
Now you'll have more fun
than ever when traveling!
<k> stg6_rsh_c_42_02 <p>
All right, then.
<k> stg6_rsh_c_42_03 You want more travel tips?
<wait 250>
OK, let's see...
<k>
<p>
Number one!<wait 250> Travel alone!
<k>
<p>
Striking out on your own can
remind you how important
friends and family are.
<k> stg6_rsh_c_43 The food here is all
mushrooms, all the time...
<k>
<p>
And I don't even like
mushrooms...<wait 250> What do I do?
<k> stg6_rsh_c_44 People see train enthusiasts
as obsessive freaks...
<wait 250>
You know, kind of geeky.
<k>
<p>
But I don't care at all.
<wait 250>
I really, really like it.
<wait 250>
Why should I care?

They call to my palate and

<k>
<p>
Thank you much, my friend!
<wait 250>
This is your reward!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is the dining car.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
There also seems to be a
cute little shop here.
<k>
<p>
Dining and shopping while
watching scenery go by...
<wait 250>
Talk about heavenly...
<k> 店員 <keyxon>
That's the Sales Stall owner.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
You can buy and sell things
here, obviously.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, just about the only
thing cooler than traveling
is traveling AND shopping!
<k> コック <keyxon>
This is Chef Shimi, the cook
aboard the Excess Express.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He cooks for EVERYBODY!
<k>
<p>
I can't figure this guy out.
<wait 250>
I have no idea if he's joking
most of the time.
<k> ウェイトレス <keyxon>
That's the waitress of the
Excess Express.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Kinda spacey.
Think she's an OK waitress?
<k>
<p>
Probably not...<wait 250>but guys always
go for girls like this, don't
they? <wait 250>Why is that, Mario?
<k> トロン <keyxon>
I KNEW I knew him!<wait 250> That's
Zip Toad, the movie star!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Women go NUTS for him!
<k>
<p>
Y'know, he's hot and all,
but he seems pretty stuck
up about being famous.
<k>
<p>
I guess all celebrities are
kinda like that.<wait 300> It's too bad,
'cause I kinda liked him...
<k> サラリーマン <keyxon>
He's a Ratooey businessman.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's on the Excess Express
for business, obviously.
<k>
<p>
I bet he's putting everything
on an expense account, huh?
<wait 300>
Is that a fringe benefit?
<k> ポワン探偵 <keyxon>
That's Pennington, a train
passenger.<dkey><wait 400></dkey> He SAYS he's a
detective, but I don't know...
<k>
<p>
I mean, why do detective
types ALWAYS show up when
something goes wrong, huh?
<k> 乗客１ <keyxon>
That's a passenger on the
Excess Express.
<k>
<p>
Not to change the subject,
but watching your health
abroad is super-important.
<k>
<p>
You wouldn't want to get
sick and spoil the whole trip,
would you?
<k> 乗客２ <keyxon>
That's a passenger on the
Excess Express.
<k>
<p>
The food on this train is
so good, I bet people overeat
while traveling.
<k>
<p>
Then they have to go on
diets as soon as they get off!
<wait 250>
That'd be weak!
<k>  

stg6_rsh_06 Hello to you, and welcome
to the Excess Express!<wait 250> I am
the conductor of this train.
<k>

And I trust you must be...
<wait 250>
Mr. Mario, from room 5?
<dkey><wait 500></dkey>
Make yourself at home, sir.
<k> stg6_rsh_06_01 What's that?!?<wait 250> Some sort of
a sticky, yummy threat?!?
<k>
<p>
I-I see!<wait 250> Good gracious me!
<wait 250>
If I hear anything else, I will
let you know immediately!
<k> stg6_rsh_07 Sir!<wait 250> If I hear anything else
about the sticky threat, I will
let you know immediately!
<k> stg6_rsh_08 This is the luggage car.
<wait 250>
I'm sorry, but I can't let
passengers in here, sir.
<k> stg6_rsh_14 I am on my way back home.
<wait 250>
I have strayed so long, I have
forgotten what it looks like!
<k>
 stg6_rsh_15 Oh, you are the champion of
the Glitz Pit, are you not?
<wait 250>
Yes, the Great Gonzales!
<k>
<p>
Bound for Poshley Heights?
<wait 250>
Well, it is certainly a fitting
place for a celebrity like you!
<k> stg6_rsh_16 We are en route to Poshley
Heights to buy a birthday
present for little Bub, here.
<k>
<p>
<wave>
Ahhhh hm hm hm hm hm hm!

<wait 250>
My, my, my.

 stg6_rsh_17 Yeah, I'm Bub,<wait 250> and we're
gonna get a birthday present

<k>
<p>
Aren't you jealous?
<k>
 stg6_rsh_18 Me? <wait 250>I have a very important
deal to attend to once we
arrive in Poshley Heights.
<k>
<p>
I'm traveling on business, so
everything goes on the
expense account!<wait 250> Yes!
<k> stg6_rsh_65 Ah-ha!<wait 250> I have been waiting!
<k>
<p>
I was rather impressed with
your work on this last case,
I must admit.
<k>
<p>
However, I do not think the
one you apprehended is our
sticky, yummy malcontent...
<k>
<p>
I have deduced this from the
lack of any incriminating
clues in his room...
<k>
<p>
In any case, I must say...
<wait 250>
I believe you have a certain
knack for detective work.
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3.0>
So it is decided, then.
</dynamic>
<wait 200>
I shall take you on as my
new assistant!
<k> stg6_rsh_66 To reiterate...<wait 350> My name is
Pennington.<wait 250> I am a detective
from Poshley Heights.
<k>
<p>
I am known in some circles
as "The Penguin With the
Improbably Large Brain."
<k>
<p>
I am sure you have heard of
me, so that is all I will
say on the subject.
<k>
<p>
And as for your name...<wait 250> Wait!
<wait 250>
I demand you do not tell me.
<k>
<p>
I shall deduce your identity!
<k> stg6_rsh_67 That mustache...<wait 500> That nose...
<wait 500>
......
<k>
<p>
<wave>
Ho ho ho!<wait 250> All too easy!
</wave>
You, sir, are quite <dynamic 4.0>
obviously
</dynamic>
the famed <col 008000ff>
Luigi</col>, are you not?
<k> stg6_rsh_68 No need to introduce
yourself!<wait 250> I know all about
the famous <col 008000ff>
Luigi</col>!
<k>
<p>
Now, about this threat...
<wait 300>
Our man has declared his
intent to yummify the train...
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
A sticky, tasty explosion...
<wait 250>
That family of Bob-ombs!
<wait 250>
They are definitely suspect!
<k>
<p>
Now, <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>!<wait 250> We will reduce
this case to <dynamic 4.0>rudimentary
</dynamic>
<wait 350>
facts and deduce the truth!
<k> stg6_rsh_69 Take heed now, <col 008000ff>
Luigi</col>!
<wait 250>
Our man has declared his
intent to yummify the train...
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
A sticky, tasty explosion...
<wait 250>
That family of Bob-ombs!
<wait 250>
They are definitely suspect!
<k>
<p>
Even as we speak... <wait 250>Yes!
<wait 250>
Do you smell their fuses
burning in conspiracy?!?
<k> stg6_rsh_79 I was really looking forward
to plopping that stew on my
expense account...
<k>
<p>
Oh, well, I'll just order the
next most expensive thing on
the dinner menu!
<k> stg6_rsh_79_01 I'm going to try to get all
my paperwork done today so
I can enjoy myself tomorrow.
<k>
<p>
So, uh, could you just stay
out of my way for a while?
<k> stg6_rsh_84_01 There's been a lot of noise
coming from room 8 with the
Goldbob family...
<k>
<p>
My guess is, they're having
a little domestic squabble...
<wait 250>
Not that it's my business.
<k> stg6_rsh_90 Mom and Dad are fighting
about what to get me for
my birthday...
<k>
<p>
I'm so bored...<wait 250> I wish I'd
brought my GBA.
<k> stg6_rsh_85_01 <small>
<scale 0.67>
...Are you even
listening?
<wait 350>
<p>
That's what
I'm saying!
<wait 800>
<p>
He's our
little Bub!
<wait 800>
<p>
His present
obviously...
<wait 800>
<p>
needs to be
much more...
<wait 800>
<p>
expensive and
utterly gaudy!
<wait 800>
<p>
I mean, don't
you think so?
<wait 800>
<p>
Because that
way, clearly...
<wait 800>
<p>
he'll remember
it longer!
<wait 800>
<p>
And that's
why you need...
<wait 800>
<p>
to think long
and hard...
<wait 800>
<p>
about what
I'm saying!
<wait 800>
<p>
<wait 300>
<o> stg6_rsh_85_02 <small>
<scale 0.67>
No, no, no, no,
no, NO, dear!
<wait 800>
<p>
We must think
more about...
<wait 800>
<p>
little Bub's
future!
<wait 800>
<p>
Do you hear
me talking?
<wait 800>
<p>
He needs
something...
<wait 800>
<p>
useful, dear!
Not a toy!
<wait 800>
<p>
And that is
why you must...
<wait 800>
<p>
just use your
brain and...
<wait 800>
<p>
think just
a little...
<wait 800>
<p>
bit harder
on exactly...
<wait 800>
<p>
what I am
saying to you!
<wait 800>
<p>
<o> stg6_rsh_86 I think we should get little
Bub the Advanced Learners
Classic Series of Bob-ombery!
<k> stg6_rsh_87 Two words: <wait 250>cheap and boring!
<wait 250>
Think more luxurious, dear!
<wait 250>
Perhaps a car, or a house!
<k> stg6_rsh_88 Bub is too small for such
things, Goldbob!<wait 250> Stop thinking
of your own social status!
<k>
<p>
He needs something that will
further his education, not
spoil him! <wait 250>Honestly!
<k> stg6_rsh_88_01 Pfffffffffft!
<wait 250>
I don't want any of that
stuff they're talking about...
<k> stg6_rsh_85 We must get him something
that befits the station of
our family!
<k>
<p>
I have my reputation to think
of, Sylvia!
<k> stg6_rsh_89 Well, I still think we should
get him the Classic Series
of Bob-ombery...
<k> stg6_rsh_91 Hey, Mister...<wait 250> Are you a

quit being a champion?
<k>

<o> stg6_rsh_92 <p>
Really? <wait 250>Cool!

OK, if you bring me what I

<wait 250>
That's just what I wanted!
<wait 250>
You're a good detective!
<k>
<p>
Here's something for you,
just like I said.
<k> stg6_rsh_99 Thanks for the autograph.
<wait 250>
I'll take good care of it,
I promise.
<k> stg6_rsh_100 Nope!<wait 250> Not even close!
<wait 250>
Hey, Mister...<wait 250> Are you sure
you're really a detective?
<k> stg6_rsh_101 You haven't found it yet?
<wait 250>
My hint was that it started
with "<dynamic 4.0>A</dynamic>"!<wait 250> Got it?
<k> stg6_rsh_102 Hey, uh...<wait 250> By the way...
<wait 250>
What's a detective, anyway?
<k> stg6_rsh_103 The thing that young master
Bub wants most?<wait 250> Well, let
us deduce, shall we?
<k>
<p>
Why, <dynamic 4.0>it is rudimentary!
</dynamic>
He wants a Game Boy
Advance, my dear <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>...
<k>
<p>
Because that, my friend, is
what young children his age
crave above all things! 
<k> stg6_rsh_104 So, it was an autograph,
was it, <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>? Mmmmm...yes.
<wait 250>
Just as I suspected...
<k>
<p>
Oh, the conductor just came
by looking for you, <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>.
<wait 250>
This smells of a new mystery!
<k> stg6_rsh_105 I can hear everything that
family's fighting about loud
and clear from out here...
<k>
<p>
One thing I heard was cute...
<wait 250>
That boy dreams of being a
train engineer someday!
<k>
<p>
What an interesting dream
for a rich little kid like that!
<wait 250>
Heh heh heh heh...
<k> stg6_rsh_106 What does that little Bub kid
want as a present?
<wait 250>
Uh............................................
<k>
<p>
Well, I'm sure he'd be
stoked to have an autograph
of mine, right, guy?
<k>
<p>
Oh, man, don't they all?
<wait 250>
I can't do it, unfortunately.
<wait 250>
I only sign for chicks.
<k> stg6_rsh_107_0 Hey...
<k>
<p>
You don't think Bub might
want something from someone
he admires, do you?
<k>
<p>
Well, we'd better find
whatever it is soon, or we'll
meet a yummy, sticky end!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_1 Say...
<k>
<p>
You don't suppose that Bub
wants something from a
person he admires?
<k>
<p>
Whatever it is, we have to
find it quickly or we'll
end up yummy and sticky!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_2 Hey, Gonzales!
<k>
<p>
You think that Bub kid might
want something from a guy
he admires, maybe?
<k>
<p>
Whatever he wants, we gotta
find it soon or else BOOM!
<wait 250>
Yummy and sticky!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_3 Mario, darling...
<k>
<p>
Don't you think perhaps the
young child wants something
from someone he admires?
<k>
<p>
Whatever it is he craves,
we must find it before the
train goes yummy and sticky!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_4 Uh, Mario...
<k>
<p>
Is there any chance Bub
wants something from a
person he admires?
<k>
<p>
Well, whatever it is, we'd
better find it before we
meet a yummy, sticky end!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_5 I say, old boy...
<k>
<p>
Might this Bub tyke merely
want something from someone
he admires?
<k>
<p>
Whatever he craves, we'd
best find it soon, old boy!
<wait 250>
The train is in danger!
<k> stg6_rsh_107_6 Hmmmm...
<k>
<p>
Perhaps that young Bub child
just wants something from
someone he admires...
<k>
<p>
Whatever it is, we must
find it soon!<wait 250> A yummy, sticky
danger is out there!
<k> stg6_rsh_111 Mr. Mario!<wait 250> I'm glad you spoke
to me! <wait 250>I just remembered
something suspicious!
<k>
<p>
I found myself one blanket
short when I was handing
them out to passengers.
<k>
<p>
I gave the last passenger
my own blanket to make up
for it, but it's vexing...
<k>
<p>
I have exact blanket counts.
<wait 250>
It means someone came on
board without a ticket...
<k>
<p>
That stowaway just might be
your suspect, Mr. Mario...
<k>
<p>
Not only that, but if I don't
get my blanket back, I'll be
too chilly to sleep tonight.
<k>
<p>
If you could look for the
unticketed passenger and get
that blanket...<wait 250>I'd thank you.
<o>
 stg6_rsh_112 <p>
Honestly?<wait 250> Great, thanks!
<k>
<p>
Well, I have to keep watch
here, but I'll be waiting
for the good news!
<k> stg6_rsh_113 <p>
Oh, really...<wait 250> That's too bad...
<wait 250>
I guess I'll just huddle
under a candy wrapper...
<k> stg6_rsh_114 Mario,<wait 250> won't you please look
for the unticketed passenger
and get that blanket back?
<o> stg6_rsh_114_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Call me "Blanket P.I."!
I don't have time. stg6_rsh_115 If I don't get that blanket
back, I'll just have to stay
up all night or something...
<k>
<p>
Please, please find it, Mario.
<wait 250>
I'm counting on you.
<k> stg6_rsh_116 What's this?<wait 250> There's an
unticketed passenger?
<wait 250>
Just as I suspected!
<k>
<p>
The conductor was one
blanket short, eh?<wait 250> Then we
are hunting a lone intruder!
<k>
<p>
That would definitely rule
out the family in cabin 8!
<wait 250>
Rudimentary, my boy!
<k>
<p>
And that is the only hint I
will give you today, my
sleuth apprentice!
<k>
<p>
You must strike out on your
own with that little nugget
of investigative wisdom!
<k>
<p>
Of course, I have other hints
to share if I so choose...
<wait 250>
No, truly!
<k>
<p>
For example... The unticketed
passenger is without a doubt
our yummy, sticky suspect!
<k> stg6_rsh_124 The unticketed passenger
was a ghost?!?
<k>
<p>
My dear <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>, you are
delusional!<wait 250> Do you have
the vapors, lad?
<k> stg6_rsh_125 A ghost on the train?
<k>
<p>
Well, does this ghost have
a ticket?
<k>
<p>
Because I certainly do!
<wait 250>
I bought one fair and square...
<k>
<p>
<scale 0.8>
...With my expense account...
</scale>
<k> stg6_rsh_126 Did you find it?
<k> stg6_rsh_127 WHAAAAAT?!?<wait 250> A GHOST?!?
<shake>
EEEEEEEEEEEEEK!
</shake>
<k>
<p>
A-And...<wait 250>he won't give you the
blanket unless you get his
diary from the baggage car?
<k>
<p>
I see...<wait 250> Well, go on in.
<wait 250>
You don't say no to ghosts!
<k> stg6_rsh_129_01 Please, go in, sir.
<k>
 stg6_rsh_129 Did you find the diary?
<wait 250>
Wonderful!<wait 250> I knew you would!
<k>
<p>
Now, I cannot leave my post.
<wait 250>
Please return the diary
while I stay here!

<p>
Though I WOULD like to see

<k> stg6_rsh_142 So, Mr. Mario, how did it go?
<k>
 stg6_rsh_143 Oh, thank you so much!
<wait 250>
Now I'll be comfortable
tonight!
<k>
<p>
Of course, our yummy and
sticky mischief-maker is
still at large...
<k>
<p>
Oh, hey, before I forget...
<wait 250>
This is just a gesture of
my thanks.
<k> stg6_rsh_145 It's getting late, Mr. Mario.
<wait 250>
Perhaps you should just turn
in for the night?
<k>
<p>
If anything happens, I'll report
it to you immediately.
<wait 250>
Do not worry about a thing.
<k>
<p>
For I am the conductor of
the Excess Express!
<k> stg6_rsh_147 I see...<wait 250> So it was not, in fact,
our yummy, sticky suspect?
<wait 250>
Just as I suspected!
<k>
<p>
The mystery deepens...
<k>
<p>
It is getting rather late.
<wait 250>
Let us turn in and work on
this case tomorrow.
<k> stg6_rsh_147_08 It's been hard keeping night
watch lately.<wait 250> It was a piece
of cake when I was young...
<k> stg6_rsh_147_09 Good gracious!<wait 250> I just noticed
there are only two beds
in here!
<k>
<p>
Does that mean I'm to share
a bed with the wife?
<k>
<p>
.......................................
<k>
<p>
Do they not know she
explodes regularly in her
sleep?<wait 250> I demand a refund!
<k> stg6_rsh_147_10 My, there are only two beds!
<k>
<p>
I suppose I'll share the
bed with Bub. <wait 250>Dear Goldbob's
night sweats are repugnant.
<k> stg6_rsh_147_11 It's time for sleepies.
<wait 250>
Dad says ghosts come out if
you stay up late.
<k> stg6_rsh_158 Hello, Detective Mario.
<wait 250>
I saw no one suspicious
during the night.
<k>
<p>
We will be stopping at
Riverside Station today.
<wait 250>
...Around dusk, I believe.
<k> stg6_rsh_159 This is the baggage car,
as I believe you well know.
<wait 250>
No passengers allowed.
<k> stg6_rsh_163 Top of the morning to you,
Gonzales!
<k>
<p>
I'm afraid you saw us at our
arguing worst yesterday...
<wait 250>
I feel rather ashamed.
<k> stg6_rsh_164 Little Bub sure has been in
high spirits since yesterday...
<wait 250>
I wonder why he's so happy?
<k> stg6_rsh_165 Good morning, Mister!

Thanks for the autograph

<k> stg6_rsh_167 Ah, my dear <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>!
<wait 250>
Your timing is impeccable!
<wait 250>
A new case has arisen!
<k>
<p>
Now then, Mr. Businessman,
please explain the facts to
my assistant, <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>.
<k> stg6_rsh_168 <shake>
OK, OK, here's the deal...
<wait 250>
When I woke up this morning,
my briefcase was gone!
<k>
<p>
It contained all the contracts
for our next deal, and even
our new product prototype!
<k>
<p>
If I don't recover it, I'll
lose my job at the LEAST!
</shake>
<k> stg6_rsh_168_01 Now, now, calm yourself...
<wait 250>
The next part is vital.
<wait 250>
So tell <col 008000ff>Luigi</col> very slowly.
<k> stg6_rsh_168_02 <wait 100>
Of course, of course...
<wait 250>
Our company's new product
is "Nitro Honey Syrup"...
<k>
<p>
Used properly, it's an amazing
product that can even
raise the dead...
<k>
<p>
But if mixed with the calcium
from a seashell and a bit
of gold...
<k>
<p>
Well, then!<wait 250> The results are
<dynamic 3><shake>EXPLOSIVE</shake></dynamic>!
<k>
<p>
The resulting goo-blast would
immobilize everyone here in
a sticky, yet yummy, shellac!
<k>
<p>
If it's fallen into the
wrong hands...<wait 250> Well, I could
lose more than my job!
<k>
 stg6_rsh_169_00 Let's examine these facts,
shall we?<wait 250> Someone has stolen
your briefcase...
<k> stg6_rsh_169_01 Though you definitely had
it yesterday...<wait 250> Hmmmm...
<k> stg6_rsh_169_02 And the train has not
stopped at all in the
intervening time...
<k> stg6_rsh_169_03 I have it! <wait 250>Rudimentary,
my dear <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>! <wait 250>Rudimentary!
<wait 250>
The thief is still on the train!
<k>
<p>

<scale 0.8>
Ah-ha!
</scale>
<k> stg6_rsh_169_04 <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>!<wait 250> Have you spoken to
the waitress and the lady
in cabin 2?
<k>
<p>
They have both lost
something on this train!
<k>
<p>
The waitress lost Shell
Earrings...
<k>
<p>
And the lady, Toodles, lost a
Gold Ring!
<k>
<p>
<col 008000ff>Luigi</col>, if the same person
who stole those objects also
has the Nitro Honey Syrup...
<k>
<p>
They could make this goo-
blast! <wait 250>They could carry out
the threat in the note!
<k>
<p>
So, it is simple, <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>!
<wait 250>
You must find that thief!
<k>
<p>
We must apprehend the
suspect before this dastardly
plan is put into effect!
<k> stg6_rsh_170 There is but one option, <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>!
<wait 250>
You must find that thief!
<k>

We must apprehend the
suspect before this dastardly
plan is put into effect!

 stg6_rsh_172 Have you stumbled upon any
new clues?
<k> stg6_rsh_173 What is this paper, hmmmm?
<wait 250>
What sort of clue is this
supposed to be?
<k> stg6_rsh_173_2 No clues?!?<wait 250> Unacceptable!

Just as I suspected!

Luigi</col>...<wait 250> Where did you find
this very important clue?
<k> stg6_rsh_177_00 Cabin 1, you say... <wait 250>Yes...
<wait 250>
Zip Toad's room. <wait 250>A place
I have long suspected!
<k>
<p>
Come to think of it, I do not
believe I've seen him today.
<k>
<p>
...Then perhaps he is hiding
somewhere on the train.
<wait 250>
Always one step ahead!
<k>
<p>
Very well, my dear <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>...
<wait 250>
Find that Zip Toad!
<k> stg6_rsh_177_01 You know what you need to
do, do you not, <col 008000ff>Luigi</col>?
<wait 250>
Find that Zip Toad!
<k>
<p>
He must be hiding somewhere
on the train, so search
absolutely everywhere!
<k> stg6_rsh_213 We are now stopped at
Riverside Station,
Detective Mario.
<k>
<p>
Why don't you go outside
and enjoy the nice, fresh air?
<k> stg6_rsh_214 Little Bub has gone outside.
<k>
<p>
Who knew he liked trains
so much, hm?
<k> stg6_rsh_215 Thank you so, so much!

If I had lost that briefcase
AND my job, my wife really
would've let me have it!
<k> stg6_rsh_220 Hello, Detective Mario.
<wait 250>
I guess we owe you again for
getting us out of Riverside.

<k> stg6_rsh_225 Well, I will finally get home
tomorrow.<wait 250> It's been a rather
long time, to be honest...

But the hour has grown late.

You should get some rest,

<k> stg6_rsh_226 Who knew my little Bub liked
trains so much?

Perhaps I'll get him a solid-

to Poshley Heights.
<k> stg6_rsh_227 Hello, Mr. Gonzales.
<wait 250>
I've heard all about your
present for little Bub.
<k>

You gave him the engineer's
autograph, didn't you?
<k>
<p>
I wish we'd thought of that.
<wait 250>
Goldbob and I would SO like
to please him on his big day!

So, um, so, um...<wait 250> My mom

<p>
He made a ton on his book

He said he left the crime

I wonder what he'll do now...
<wait 250>
He could always come back
here, I guess.
<k> tik_002_09 Hey there, Mr. Adventurer.
<k>
<p>
Sounds like Pierre got his
old job with the geological
survey team back.
<k>
<p>
I guess he's a legit member
of society again finally...

Know what you've earned?
<wait 250>
This <ITEM>!
<k> tik_shop_29 You've, uh, earned a gift
with your shop points, but
you can't carry it right now.
<k>
<p>
Is there anything else I can
do for you?
<o> shop_30 Uh, hi there. <wait 250>Welcome!
<wait 250>
Is this your first time in
a shop? <wait 250>Yeah?
<k>
<p>
Let me just explain our
shop-point system like I
do with all new customers.
<k>
 shop_31 Customers receive one shop
point for each purchase they
make, understand?
<k>
<p>
Save up enough shop points
and you can get prizes,
<wait 250>
including some rare items.
<k>
<p>
You'll find a list of prizes
posted in any shop, so be
sure to take a look.
<k>
<p>
It's a pretty simple promotion,
but a cool one too, y'know?
<wait 250>
Need me to explain it again?
<o> shop_32 <p>
OK, uh, in that case...
<k>
 shop_33 <p>
Well, uh, take your time,
and enjoy your shopping.
<k> shop_34 You saved up 300 shop
points!<wait 250> That's the most ever!
<wait 250>
The maximum!<wait 250> Nice!
<k>
<p>
Well, I guess from here...
<k>
<p>
Wow! <wait 250>This is exciting!
<wait 250>
You'll love this!
<k>
<p>
You, uh, start collecting
points all over again.
<k>
<p>
Oh, and you get the amazing
300-point present!
<wait 250>
A Gold Bar x 3!
<k> starmaniac_00 My name is Dazzle!<wait 250> And I
collect Star Pieces!<wait 250> The more
I collect, the happier I am!
<k>
<p>
So, guy,<wait 250> if you have any
Star Pieces, I'll trade you my
badges for them! <wait 250>Yay!
<k>
<p>
Come on!<wait 250> Let's trade!
<o> starmaniac_01 My name is Dazzle!<wait 250> And I'll
trade my badges for any
Star Pieces you have!
<o> starmaniac_02 Do you want to trade Star
Pieces for badges?
<k>
<p>
Oh, but I'm all out of badges...
<wait 250>
I'm so sorry, guy!
<k> starmaniac_03 <select 0 1 0 40>
I'll do it!
No way! starmaniac_04 Want to trade some more?
<o> starmaniac_05 <p>
OK!<wait 250> See you later!
<k> starmaniac_06 <p>
Hey!<wait 250> You don't have any
Star Pieces! <wait 250>Are you trying
to swindle me?<wait 250> Go away!
<k> starmaniac_07 <p>
Which badge do you want
to trade for?
<k> starmaniac_08 What? <wait 250>You changed your
mind?<wait 250> So...<wait 250>LAME!!!
<k> starmaniac_09 I'll trade <ITEM>
for sweet, sweet Star Pieces!
<wait 250>
How does <NUM><N> sound?
<k>
<p>
You need %d BP to wear this
badge, OK, guy?
<k>
<p>
Are you sure you want it?
<o> starmaniac_10 <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No starmaniac_11 <p>
What?<wait 250> Changed your mind?
<wait 250>
You aren't very decisive,
are you, guy?
<k>
<p>
Then, do you want to trade
for a different badge?
<k> starmaniac_12 <p>
YESSS!<wait 250> Thanks to you, guy,
my Star Piece collection is
even bigger now! <wait 250>YESSS!
<k>
<p>
Maybe we can trade again
sometime, yeah?
<k> starmaniac_13 <p>
Hey, guy!<wait 250> Come on, now!
<wait 250>
Can't we trade some more?
<o> starmaniac_14 <p>
What?<wait 250> Changed your mind?
<k>
<p>
Thanks to you, guy, my Star
Piece collection has grown!
<k>
<p>
Maybe we can trade again
sometime, yeah?
<k> starmaniac_15 <p>
You can't carry any more
badges!<wait 250> Come trade with me
after you sell some badges!
<k> johoyaketi_00 <wave>
HOWWWWWWWWDEEEEEEEE!!!
</wave><wait 250>
My name's Wonky, and I
just know stuff!
<k>
<p>
I may not look like much,
but I know a thing or two,
you'd better believe it!
<k>
<p>
And who knows?<wait 250> The stuff
I know may even be stuff
that could help you!
<k>
<p>
So, if you want to ask me
a question, just speak up,
and ask away!
<k> johoyaketi_01 <shake>
Uh huh huh huh huh huh!
</shake>
<wait 250>
Something you want to ask
of old Wonky, right?
<k>
<p>
If you pay me <NUM> coin<S>, I
suppose I can tell you about
%.*s!
<k>
<o> johoyaketi_02 <select 0 1 0 40>
I'll pay.
Never mind. johoyaketi_03 <p>
<col c00000ff>????????
<k>
<o> johoyaketi_04 <p>
If you need to know stuff
about stuff, just ask me!
<k> johoyaketi_05 <p>
If that's the case, then
what's a guy supposed to do?
<k>
<p>
Well, I can't charge you to
tell you what I told you
once before, I guess...
<k>
<o> johoyaketi_06 <shake>
Uh huh huh huh huh huh!
</shake>
<wait 240>
I guess that's best, since
I have no new stuff to tell.
<k>
<p>
But I CAN tell you what I
told you before, and I won't
even charge you for it!
<k>
<o> johoyaketi_07 <p>
<wait 250>
And that...<wait 250>is...<wait 250>that!
<wait 250>
If you need anything else,
just ask old Wonky!
<k> johoyaketi_08 Uh huh huh huh huh huh!
<wait 240>
My apologies, but I told
you all the stuff I know.
<k>
<p>
Of course, I might learn
some new stuff soon, so
check back with Wonky!
<k> johoyaketi_09 <p>
You don't have enough coins!
<wait 250>
You must have cash before
you try to buy something!
<k> jketi_code_0000 <!STG0_00,the legend of Rogueport>
<p>
You've heard about the
legendary treasure hidden
beneath Rogueport, right?
<k>
<p>
Apparently it's the vast
fortune of that ancient,
forgotten civilization...
<k>
<p>
Most people think that's
just a silly old myth now,
of course.<wait 250> But not Wonky!
<k>
<p>
According to my sources,
it's the real deal.
<k>
<p>
Huh?<wait 250> Who are my sources?
<k>
<p>
Well, I can't really say, can I?
<wait 250>
That, my friend, is what's
called a trade secret!
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0001 <!STG0_00,the Z Button>
<p>
Hey, ol' Wonky just heard
something kind of helpful.
<k>
<p>
If you press <icon PAD_Z_OFF 0.5 -22 34 -10> when you're
talking to someone, you go
back to what they said last.
<k>
<p>
I'm sure that could be handy
in a pinch!
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0002 <!STG0_00,the incident I saw>
<p>
So I saw this really cute
girl in a pink dress walking
around town a while back.
<k>
<p>
She was pretty enough to be
a princess, I tell ya!
<k>
<p>
She hung around town for a
little while after buying
something from that old lady.
<k>
<p>
Then she got nabbed in a
back alley by a bunch of
suspicious guys in white suits!
<k>
<p>
I'm pretty sure I'm the only
person who saw that, though.
<wait 250>
Ol' Wonky was scared!
<k>
<p>
Well...<wait 250> I guess it's neither
here nor there...<wait 250> People get
kidnapped, whatever.
<k>
<p>
Still, just knowing what's
going on in the streets can
be helpful sometimes.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0003 <!STG0_00,battle techniques>
<p>
I hear the best way to fill
your battle crowd up is to
succeed at Action Commands.
<k>
<p>
Especially when you succeed
at several in a row. <wait 250>Hoo!
<wait 250>
I hear THAT'S great!
<k>
<p>
Also, beating enemies quickly
and striking first can
build your crowd, too.
<k>
<p>
That might be good to
remember.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0004 <!STG0_00,what's behind the sign>
<p>
There's a billboard in front
of the shop in town with all
kinds of stuff written on it...
<k>
<p>
Well, some folks like to write
graffiti on the back of the
message board, you know.
<k>
<p>
There's all kinds of good
stuff there, especially for
an info guy like ol' Wonky.
<k>
<p>
You should give it a gander
next time.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0005 <!STG1_17,what's hidden below>
<p>
Ol' Wonky just got this juicy
bit of info recently...
<k>
<p>
You know that small hole
down here that only a little
critter can get through?
<k>
<p>
Well, you just head out away
from the wall there...
<k>
<p>
And when you can't go any
further, jump to get
something good.
<k>
<p>
If you see that hole, you
should give it a try...
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0006 <!STG1_17,the big door>
<p>
Well, you know, there's a
really big door down here.
<k>
<p>
I've only seen it once myself,
but...
<k>
<p>
If there really is some
legendary treasure down
here, it's behind that door...
<k>
<p>
Yeah, when I saw it, I got
the feeling there was bad
stuff going down in there...
<k>
<p>
In fact, I've been too
heebie-jeebied to get near
that door ever since...
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0007 <!STG2_25,the charmer>
<p>
You know, there's a charmer
named Merlee down here
somewhere...
<k>
<p>
If you get her to charm you,
you'll get good stuff in battle.
<k>
<p>
Not only that, but she's a
total babe...<wait 250> Ol' Wonky would
LOVE to get a date with her!
<k>
<p>
I'm serious. <wait 250>You have to
check her out sometime.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0008 <!STG2_25,the mysterious troops>
<p>
I've gotten word of a strange
group skulking about
Rogueport recently.
<k>
<p>
They wear masks and weird
costumes with an "X" on the
front... <wait 250>Talk about kooky.
<k>
<p>
And they're always huddled
together mumbling about
some treasure.
<k>
<p>
I've even heard that they
unearthed some shiny stone
down here! <wait 250>Weird...
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0009 <!STG2_25,the Trouble Center>
<p>
There's a place called the
Trouble Center on the east
side of Rogueport.
<k>
<p>
People who need help write
little notes on the board
in there...
<k>
<p>
And if you help them out,
they give you a reward of
some sort.
<k>
<p>
Ol' Wonky hears that some of
those rewards are pretty
tasty, my friend!
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0010 <!STG2_22,spin panels>
<p>
Do you know about these
spin panels scattered
around the world?
<k>
<p>
When you Spin-Jump a
spin panel...
<k>
<p>
It bumps a Star Piece right
out of the ground! <wait 250>Score!
<k>
<p>
Problem is, they look just
like regular flooring, so
it's hard to tell.
<k>
<p>
There's actually one right
in front of me, so give it
a shot, why don't you?
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0011 <!STG2_25,the Pianta Parlor>
<p>
There's a game center on
the west side of Rogueport
run by Don Pianta.
<k>
<p>
There's a hidden game there
that few people know about...
<k>
<p>
Only members are allowed to
play this special game. <wait 250>Well,
that's what ol' Wonky hears.
<k>
<p>
If you want to try it, you'll
have to find a Member's Card
somewhere...
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0012 <!STG3_32,Lahla's private life>
<p>
You know Lahla, the cute
receptionist at the Pianta
Parlor?
<k>
<p>
She never gets too personal
from beyond those iron bars,
because it's, like, business...
<k>
<p>
But if you get in there and
talk with her, she's a totally
different person!
<k>
<p>
You should get in there and
see how good your game is,
Mr. Popular!
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0013 <!STG3_32,Horsetails>
<p>
You've been to Petal
Meadows, haven't you?
<k>
<p>
Well, they have those blue-
and grey-striped poles called
Candy Pops all over, right?
<k>
<p>
I heard that one of those
will give you a Horsetail if
you hit it ten times...
<k>
<p>
You should go try that out
sometime.
<k>
<o>
 jketi_code_0014 <!STG3_32,the mystic bag>
<p>
You know about the Pit of
100 Trials down here, right?
<k>
<p>
Well, somewhere down there
is an item called a Strange
Sack. <wait 250>This thing is great.
<k>
<p>
If you've got it, you can
hold up to 20 items!
<k>
<p>
And you know what that
means, my good friend...
<wait 250>
Easy adventuring!
<k>
<p>
No adventurer should be
without one, take it from
ol' Wonky!
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0015 <!STG3_32,Yoshi colors>
<p>
Way, way down to the south
is an island where lots of
Yoshis live.
<k>
<p>
And Yoshis are born from
eggs, as everyone knows...
<k>
<p>
But a Yoshi's color depends
on its egg conditions right
before hatching.
<k>
<p>
So it's always a surprise
to see what comes out.
<wait 250>
...Know what I mean?
<k>
<p>
Your Yoshi has a rather nice
color, by the way.
<k>
<p>
I'm sure he'll grow up to
be a fine Yoshi, yup.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0016 <!STG3_32,monsters' weaknesses>
<p>
There're a lot of mean
monsters in this world, but
many have weaknesses.
<k>
<p>
Everybody knows that fire
monsters are weak against
ice and vice versa...
<k>
<p>
But flying monsters are weak
against wind, and they tend
to get dizzy easily...
<k>
<p>
And sometimes machine- and
cloud-monsters can be easier
to freeze than most...
<k>
<p>
I've even heard that it's
very easy to put Piranha
Plants to sleep...
<k>
<p>
I'd say, try out some new
things and see if you can
find all monsters' weaknesses.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0017 <!STG4_15,the minstrel>
<p>
Somewhere here in Rogueport
there's a minstrel by the
name of Grifty.
<k>
<p>
He knows all the old legends
of Rogueport...
<k>
<p>
And he'll tell you interesting
tales you've never heard
before, I'm pretty sure.
<k>
<p>
So, if you find him, you
should definitely listen
to at least one.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0018 <!STG4_15,the secret of Boggly Woods>
<p>
Deep in Boggly Woods is a
spot with a bunch of tree
stumps all lined up...
<k>
<p>
If you jump hard on the
tenth stump from the left,
you'll get something good.
<k>
<p>
Now, I don't know what it is,
but I hear it's really good.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0019 <!STG4_15,finding Star Pieces>
<p>
You've heard of Star Pieces,
of course...
<k>
<p>
Yes, they're no less than
pieces of actual stars that
have fallen to earth...
<k>
<p>
They're so pretty and shiny
that anyone who stumbles on
one turns into a collector.
<k>
<p>
If you want to find some,
just check out all the nooks
of each area you visit.
<k>
<p>
They always seem to be
slightly hidden, know what
I mean?
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0020 <!STG4_15,how to save money>
<p>
Did you notice that you can
only carry up to 999 coins?
<k>
<p>
Well, if you ever want to
collect more...
<k>
<p>
You should buy Gold Bars at
the shop near here...
<k>
<p>
And then store them at the
shop, where you can convert
them back to coins anytime.
<k>
<p>
They may sell for slightly
less than you buy them for...
<k>
<p>
But it's better than losing
all the coins you wouldn't
be able to pick up, right?
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0021 <!STG4_15,Amazy Dayzees>
<p>
I've heard tales of an
Amazy Dayzee, a truly rare
breed among Dayzees...
<k>
<p>
They're worth oodles of
Star Points, but they're timid
and tend to run away fast.
<k>
<p>
Still, I bet if you kept
visiting the same area, you
could meet one again...
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0022 <!STG5_43,striking first>
<p>
Don't you love it when you
strike first on the field and
get that first attack in?
<k>
<p>
If you use a Spin Jump
or Bobbery's Bomb attack to
strike first...
<k>
<p>
Then your first attack will
have more power than just a
jump or hammer move, see?
<k>
<p>
It's not a big thing, but it's
worth remembering!
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0023 <!STG5_43,Grubba from Glitzville>
<p>
So about that Grubba in
Glitzville...
<k>
<p>
He went from a mediocre
fighter to the ruler of
Glitzville in a matter of years.
<k>
<p>
And there's a rumor that it
was all because he found a
glittering gem somewhere.
<k>
<p>
I don't know what kind of
stone it was, but it must've
been a nice good-luck charm.
<k>
<p>
Then again, I heard he hasn't
been seen recently around
Glitzville, so who knows?
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0024 <!STG5_43,Creepy Steeple's secret>
<p>
There's a wacky old place
called Creepy Steeple
somewhere in this land...
<k>
<p>
And if you jump on the fourth
step from the top, ol' Wonky
hears you get a good thing.
<k>
<p>
I don't know how useful that
is, but hey, it's worth a shot.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0025 <!STG5_43,the Omelette Plate>
<p>
The most delicious thing ol'
Wonky has ever eaten is an
Omelette Plate...
<k>
<p>
I remember having it at the
hotel at Poshley Heights.
<k>
<p>
It was made by that chef
of legend, Maitre Delish...
<k>
<p>
I believe it was made with a
Mushroom and a Mystic Egg.
<wait 250>
Oh, just one more bite...
<k>
<p>
I hear one can actually find
that Mystic Egg near the
Boggly Woods...
<k>
<p>
It seems the Punies are the
only ones who know where to
find them...
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0026 <!STG5_43,Chet Rippo>
<p>
There's a weird guy named
Chet Rippo who lives down
here somewhere.
<k>
<p>
I hear he'll lower one stat
and raise another for you
if you want.
<k>
<p>
And he can even power down
one of your partners to
power up another...
<k>
<p>
He may be spendy, but I'm
sure it's worth it...
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0027 <!STG6_54,the southern isle Whacka>
<p>
There's a rare creature
called a Whacka on the
southern isle.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, and if you whack him,
he drops this great little
thing called a Whacka Bump.
<k>
<p>
The thing is, people have
been whacking the Whackas
to get Whacka Bumps...
<k>
<p>
And now, only one remains
that hasn't been whacked to
extinction.<wait 250> Isn't that sad?
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0028 <!STG6_54,the pirate king, Cortez>
<p>
About a thousand years ago,
there was a pirate king
called Cortez on these seas.
<k>
<p>
He raided this city often,
striking fear into the hearts
of its inhabitants...
<k>
<p>
But Cortez was betrayed by
one of his crew...
<k>
<p>
Just before he died, he's
said to have sailed off with
all of his treasure.
<k>
<p>
Then, even after he died,
some say his spirit still
protects that treasure...
<k>
<p>
But, you know...<wait 250> That's all
just hazy legend now.
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0029 <!STG6_54,the southern isle secret>
<p>
Far to the south of
Rogueport lies an isle...
<k>
<p>
And on this isle there are
three yellow blocks in a row.
<k>
<p>
And if you do a Spring Jump
on the second of these
blocks from the bottom...
<k>
<p>
I hear you'll get something
good for your health.
<k>
<p>
But what island could this
"southern isle" be referring
to, anyway?
<k>
<o>
 jketi_code_0030 <!STG6_54,Professor Frankly's garbage>
<p>
There's a kindly old teacher
named Frankly who lives on
Rogueport's east side...
<k>
<p>
And if you check his
garbage--when he has some--
I hear you can learn stuff.
<k>
<p>
I don't know what's in
there, but if his bin has
trash in it, check it.
<k>
<p>
I've even heard there are
notes about terrifying
monsters in there...
<k>
<o>
 jketi_code_0031 <!STG6_54,the lucky Punies>
<p>
There's a place called
Boggly Woods somewhere in
this world...
<k>
<p>
And there are small beasts
named Punies who live there.
<k>
<p>
Ol' Wonky hears that anyone
who sees a Puni will have
fortune visited upon them...
<k>
<p>
Some people go to Boggly
Woods just to catch a
glimpse of a lucky Puni...

<o> jketi_code_0032 <!STG7_20,Zess T.'s sister>
<p>
About that Zess T. near
Rogueport's main square...
<k>
<p>
I've heard her sister is a
really good cook as well.
<k>
<p>
She married and moved away
a long time ago, but I'd love
to try her cooking...
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0033 <!STG7_20,the strange ones>
<p>
About Merlon on the east
side of Rogueport and
Merluvlee underground...
<k>
<p>
Ol' Wonky hears they're
from a strange tribe that
names people by profession.
<k>
<p>
So, for example, if someone
did the same work as Merlon,
they'd have the same name...
<k>
<p>
So there could be Merlons
all over.<wait 250> Don't you find
that strange?<wait 250> Wonky does!
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0034 <!STG7_20,the cold place's secret>
<p>
There's a pipe down here
that leads to a very cold
place, ol' Wonky hears...
<k>
<p>
And if you jump in front of
the tree to the far right
of the area you come out in...
<k>
<p>
Then you get something nice,
supposedly.
<k>
<p>
But you won't catch 'ol
Wonky out in a chilly place
like that, no sir!
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0035 <!STG7_20,Zess Dynamite>
<p>
You know Zess T., right?
<wait 250>
She's the really good cook
on Rogueport's main square.
<k>
<p>
Well, she has a rare recipe
in her repertoire called
Zess Dynamite...
<k>
<p>
It's made with a Coconut
Bomb and an Egg Bomb.
<k>
<p>
And by the way, an Egg
Bomb is made from a Fire
Flower and a Mystic Egg...
<k>
<p>
And a Coconut Bomb is made
from a Fire Flower and a
Coconut.
<k>
<p>
...And that's all I know,
because Zess lost the rest
of the recipe somewhere...
<k>
<p>
It was written down and she
lost it!<wait 250> What a tragedy!
<k>
<p>
It sure would be cool if she
could make it, though...
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0036 <!STG7_20,the final tale>
<p>
I heard this one from my
ol' grampa...
<k>
<p>
It's a legend about one who
will come to this town some
day in the future.
<k>
<p>
He will come when the sky
grows dark again...
<k>
<p>
Clothed in red and blue,
the hero will bear seven
stars and face the darkness...
<wait 100>
<k>
<p>
I don't know what that's
supposed to mean, but I see
that you wear red and blue.
<k>
<p>
If the hero turned out to
be you...<wait 250> Well,<wait 100> I guess that
would be a bit much, huh?
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0037 <!STG8_16,Couple's Cake>
<p>
You know Zess T., in the
square, I'm sure.<wait 250> The girl
with the mean cooking talent.
<k>
<p>
Well, she's got a secret
recipe called the Couple's
Cake.<wait 250> Cute name, huh?
<k>
<p>
To make it, she needs a
Snow Bunny and Spicy Soup...
<k>
<p>
If you bring her both,
she'll make it, at least
that's what ol' Wonky hears.
<k>
<p>
By the way, a Snow Bunny
is made from a Golden Leaf
and an Ice Storm...
<k>
<p>
And Spicy Soup is made
from a Fire Flower and
a Dried Bouquet.
<k>
<p>
Even so, I hear that this
recipe really reminds her
of her late husband...
<k>
<p>
So she doesn't make it for
just anybody.<wait 250> I wonder how
she feels about you?
<k>
<o> jketi_code_0038 <!STG8_16,behind the Trouble Center>
<p>
So there's that Trouble
Center on Rogueport's east
side, right...
<k>
<p>
Well, only a few people know
about the back entrance
to it...
<k>
<p>
Hey, I'm not saying there's
anything good in there, but
it may be worth a look.

<o> un_next_0000 <!STG0_00>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.

<p>
You defeat three Goombas

Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0002 <!STG0_11>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
A platform moves where you
beat three angry Goombas...
<wait 300>
You enter the pipe beyond it.
<k>
<p>
You go into the pipe at the
end of the room it takes you
to...
<k>
<p>
You step on the switch at
the back of that next room.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0003 <!STG0_12>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You press the switch near
where you see a small beast.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0004 <!STG0_12_01>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You climb the stairs to the
right of the place where the
small creature appears.
<k>
<p>
The strange thing in the box
gives you power.
<k>
<p>
The thing in the box wants...
<wait 300>
Something that lies left of
the box's room's entrance.
<k>
<p>
You take that and bring it
back to the black box.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0005 <!STG0_12_02>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
Near the place where the
small beast appears, you
climb the stairs.
<k>
<p>
You stand on the panel, it
glows, you transform into a
new shape, and fly left. 
<k>
<p>
Even if you don't fly well
at first, you keep trying
until you reach the far door.
<k>
<p>
You stand on the pedestal
inside the next large room.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0006 <!STG0_14>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
The place far, far below...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Past where you flew...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
There is a large door there.
<k>
<p>
You stand on the center of
the large pedestal there.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0007 <!STG0_16>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
Just after going underground,
you go to the right, turn
into a plane, and fly right.
<k>
<p>
A strange white hand
beckons you.
<k>
<p>
You attack it without delay.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0008 <!STG0_19>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
Just after going underground,
you go to the right where
you bested the white hand.
<k>
<p>
You leap on the panels to
reach a pipe. <wait 250>You enter it.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...

Then the way opens...

I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>

You go forward, ever forward.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0011 <!STG1_00_01>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You go forward, ever forward.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
When you can go no further,
you check a clump of grass.
<k>
<p>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0012 <!STG1_01>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You go forward, ever forward.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Eventually you come to a
relaxed village.
<k>
<p>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0013 <!STG1_01a>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You find the ancient shelled
one in the house with pink
outer walls.
<k>
<p>
You speak at length to him.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0014 <!STG1_02>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You speak to the shelled
gatekeeper in the village.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0015 <!STG1_03>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
When you can go no further,
you investigate a column with
a strange object atop it.
<k>
<p>
But first, you remember to
buy a POW Block somewhere...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0016 <!STG1_04>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.

I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You find the stern-faced
pillar-dweller and answer
all of his questions.
<k>
<p>
If you fail too often, you
face horrible, horrible danger.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
So you answer correctly.
<k>
<p>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0018 <!STG1_06>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You find the two keys.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then you face many small
annoyances.
<k>
<p>
You do not think you can
defeat them all.
<k>
<p>
Instead, you concentrate on
the one that stands out.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0019 <!STG1_06_01>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
In the place where you saw
the ring of stones, you place
the two keys you have found.
<k>
<p>
Two switches then appear.
<k>
<p>
You set a shell so that it
will hit one switch, then
you go to the other...
<k>
<p>
You time the shell to hit the
switch when you hit yours.
<wait 250>
Then the way opens...

I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You take the way opened by

switches.
<k>
<p>
You then go into the large
castle on the cliff.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0022 <!STG1_09_02>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
Once you have entered the
large castle, you look for
a set of remarkable bones.
<k>
<p>
You speak to them, then
hammer your way back...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...

I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You see a lock on a door in
the big, frightening castle.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
To find a key for that door...
<k>
<p>
You hit the purple switch to
lower the purple block, then
hammer the yellow block.
<k>
<p>
You then hit the yellow
switch to raise the yellow
block, and the way is clear. 
<k>
<p>
You use the shelled one's
ability to hit the red switch.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0025 <!STG1_12>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
To gain the key in the castle,
you ascend the stairs and
use the shelled one's ability. 
<k>
<p>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0026 <!STG1_12_01>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You hit the switch again to

<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
You can guess the rest.
<k>
<p>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0027 <!STG1_12_02>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
Iron bars block your way.
<wait 300>
You use the shelled one's
ability in the red-switch room.
<k>
<p>
You set the shell to hit the
switch and do not release it.
<k>
<p>
You only let it go when you
stand in front of the bars.
<k>
<p>
There is something important
in the box in the next room
that you must have.
<k>
<p>
You open the box.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Then the way opens...
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
But I feel...<wait 250>danger...

 un_next_0028 <!STG1_13>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.

Iron bars block your way.

<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
You see a key in a cell.

You turn sideways to enter

Then the way opens...

I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
In the back of a castle room
there is a switch that moves
a block up and down.
<k>
<p>
You use the shelled one and
your own ability to get atop
it and move upwards.
<k>
<p>
Then the way opens...
<k> un_next_0031 <!STG1_13_03>
I see...<wait 250>your destined path.
<k>
<p>
You climb into the heights
of the castle.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> You see many
windows and a blue switch.
<k>
<p>
You hit the switch and go
forward, then hit another
switch and go forward.
<k>

But there is no third switch.

There are plenty more where

When they attack, try to
hammer them or jump on
them while in the field...

<p>
Attack successfully and you
can perform a <col c00000ff>First Strike</col>

from Boggly Woods, right?
<wait 250>
What are you doing here?
<k> mac_1_020_nok Um...<wait 100> Aren't you one of the
creatures from Boggly Woods?
<wait 250>
Why are you down here?
<k> mac_1_021 Wh-What?!?<wait 250> Why do you know
about me?
<k>
<p>
NOOO! <wait 100>Y-You must be...
<k>
<p>
You guys are working for
those X-Nauts, aren't you?!?
<wait 250>
You chased me here!
<k>
<p>
<shake>
Noooooo! <wait 100>It's the end!!!
</shake>
<k> mac_1_022_kur X-Nauts? <wait 100>Easy there, kid.
<wait 250>
What in the world are you
freaking out about?
<k>
<p>
We're not gonna do anything
to you, so chill for a sec'!
<wait 250>
Just tell us what's going on.
<k> mac_1_022_nok X-Nauts? <wait 250>What the heck are
those?<wait 250> Sounds like tissues...
<wait 100>to the extreme or something.
<k>
<p>
Look, we're not here to do
ANYTHING to you, so relax.
<wait 250>
Tell us what's going on, OK?
<k> mac_1_023 Well...OK. <wait 250>This gang of bad
guys who call themselves
X-Nauts came to where I live.
<k>
<p>
They came inside our Great
Tree and started tearing it
apart and causing trouble.
<k>
<p>
So...<wait 250>I've come all the way
here looking for help.
<k>  mac_1_024_kur Mario!<wait 250> That sounds like
those guys who attacked us
in Rogueport.<wait 100> Right?
<k>
<p>
If they're the same guys,
then they're definitely
after the Crystal Star...
<k> mac_1_024_nok A bunch of bad guys in the
Great Tree?
<k>
<p>
If those are the same guys
who kidnapped the princess,
they want the Crystal Star!
<k> mac_1_025 Now that you mention it,
they did say something about
some Crystal Star thingy...
<k>
<p>
But we Punies don't know
anything about any crystals
or stars...
<k> mac_1_026 Say, could you guys help us
out? <wait 100>Maybe chase them off?
<wait 250>
If you do, we'll give you<wait 50>, uh...
<k>
<p>
What was it? <wait 100>The Crystal
Star?<wait 250> If you do, we'll have
the Puni elder give you that!
<k>
<p>
I don't know what it is, but if
it'll help us reclaim our tree,
<wait 250>
I'm sure the elder will agree!
<k>
<p>
So what do you say?<wait 250> Let's
not waste any more time.
<wait 250>
I'm begging you!
<k> mac_1_027 Really?!? <wait 250>You aren't joking?!?
<wait 250>
You'll do it?!?
<k> mac_1_028_kur I guess...<wait 250> I mean, we can't
just ignore them, right?
<k>
<p>
And we do need to find the
Crystal Star before those
X-whatever guys do.
<k> mac_1_028_nok Um... <wait 100>I guess we should...
<wait 250>
I'd feel pretty bad if we
didn't do anything.
<k>
<p>
Plus, we do need to get the
Crystal Stars before those
X-guys do.
<k> mac_1_029 Oh, thank you so much!
<wait 250>
This is great!<wait 250> I'm so happy!
<k>
<p>
My name is Punio.
<wait 250>
Pleased to meet you!
<k>
<p>
I'll take you to where I live.
<wait 250>
Follow me, OK?
<k> mac_1_029_00 It's this way.
<k> mac_1_029_01 Wait, hang on a second.
<k> mac_1_030 I'm sure the Puni elder said
some button around here
opened the secret entrance...
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3><scale 2.5>AH-HA!</scale></dynamic>
<k> mac_1_031 You can get to the woods we
Punies live in by going
through that pipe there.
<k>
<p>
OK!<wait 250> Hurry! Hurry!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
We're down below Rogueport.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I never knew this room was
connected like this...
<k>
<p>
If you see a similar entrance
in another area, you should
totally check it out.
<k> ƒKƒCƒh <keyxon>
That's Punio, who lives in the
Great Tree of Boggly Woods.
<k>
<p>
And hey, he must be the one
we saw earlier, right?
<wait 250>
Yeah, totally!
<k>  

mac_0_094_01 This is what that box meant!
<wait 250>
Tilt <icon STICK 0.6 -30 45 -10> Left and Right to steer
your...<wait 250>um...<wait 250>paper airplane self...
<k>
<p>
You have to be a good pilot
if you want to fly far!
<wait 250>
Try it once more!
<k> mac_0_094_01_1 It looks like if you tilt <icon STICK 0.6 -30 45 -10> away
from the way you're facing,
the plane will rise.
<k>
<p>
But...if you tilt it for too long,
you'll lose speed and crash.
<wait 250>
Time your tilts carefully!
<k> mac_1_011_kur Mario! <wait 250>Did you see that?
<wait 250>
That was one of the things
Professor Frankly described!
<k> mac_1_011_nok Hey! <wait 250>Mario! <wait 250>You see that?
<wait 250>
That was one of the things
Professor Frankly mentioned!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
Who knew the area under
Rogueport extended so far?
<wait 300>
This place is a total maze!
<k>
<p>
You really feel the grandness
of that ancient civilization
when you're down here...
<k>  

mac_0_095_kur <dynamic 3>
Oh! <wait 250>Mario! <wait 250>Goombella!
<wait 250>
Look...<wait 250>at...<wait 250>THAT!
<k> mac_0_096_kur It's the Thousand-Year Door
spoken of in the legends!
<wait 250>
I can't believe it's real!
<k>
<p>
So the legends are all true!
<wait 250>
There it is, big as life!
<wait 250>
Come!<wait 250> Let's move closer!
<k> mac_0_097_kur Hey, what's the deal with
this weird pedestal, huh?
<wait 250>
What could it be, you think?
<k> mac_0_098_kur Professor!<wait 250> What's going on?
<k> mac_0_099 <system>
The location of a Crystal
Star has been recorded on
your Magical Map!
<wait 150>
<k>
<p>
And Mario has learned a
special move!<wait 250> You can now
use Sweet Treat!
<k>
<p>
Each time you get a Crystal
Star, you'll learn a new
special move!
<k> mac_0_100_kur Professor!<wait 250> The map!!!
<k>
<p>
And what was with all those
crazy lights?
<k> mac_0_101 <dynamic 3>
Hrmmm...
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
It appears that information
related to the locations of
the Crystal Stars appeared...
<k> mac_0_101_04 And that shining light...
<wait 250>
It looked as if a mysterious
power was given to Mario...
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
Well... <wait 250>One way or another...
<wait 250>
We should return to my place
and study the map closely.
<k> mac_1_001_kur OK, Mario!<wait 250> You ready?
<wait 250>
Hold that Crystal Star up!
<k> mac_1_001_nok Um... <wait 250>All right, Mario!
<wait 250>
Hold up that Crystal Star!
<k> mac_1_001_01 <system>
The location of a Crystal
Star has been recorded on
your Magical Map!
<k> mac_1_002_kur Ooh!<wait 250> Check it out, Mario!
<wait 250>
The location of the next
Crystal Star has appeared.
<k>
<p>
But, I...<wait 100> I...<wait 100> I have NO idea
where that is!
<k> mac_1_002_nok Hey, uh, Mario, look there.
<wait 250>
The next Crystal Star showed
up on the map.
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250> I'm sorry, but I don't
have a clue where that is.
<k> mac_1_003_kur OK...<wait 250> I guess we oughta
let Professor Frankly tell
us where that place is.
<k> mac_1_003_nok Um...<wait 250> I think maybe we should
take it to Professor Frankly
and let him look at it.
<k> mac_2_001_kur Here we go again, Mario!
<wait 250>
Let's see that Crystal Star!
<k> mac_2_001_nok Um... <wait 100>Go for it, Mario!
<wait 250>
Break out the Crystal Star!
<k> mac_2_001_win Now, my little Mario!
<wait 250>
It's Crystal Star time!
<k> mac_2_001_01 <system>
The location of a Crystal
Star has been recorded on
your Magical Map!
<k> mac_2_002_kur There it is! <wait 100>The resting spot
of the next Crystal Star!
<wait 250>
Totally awesome!
<k>
<p>
But it looks like it's pointing
somewhere...<wait 100>up in the sky.
<wait 250>
Huh?<wait 100> What could that mean?
<k> mac_2_002_nok Cool! <wait 100>The next Crystal Star
showed up on the map!
<k>
<p>
Hey, but...<wait 250>is it me, or is it
up in the sky or something?
<wait 250>
Um... <wait 100>What could that mean?
<k> mac_2_002_win Oh, mercy me! <wait 100>The next
Crystal Star has made an
entrance! <wait 250>My, my, my!
<k>
<p>
But... <wait 100>Correct me if I'm wrong,
but isn't it up in the sky?
<wait 250>
What does THAT mean?
<k> mac_3_000_01 <system>
The location of a Crystal
Star has been recorded on
your Magical Map!
<k> mac_3_001_kur There's the fourth Crystal
Star.<wait 250> We're gonna have to
show Professor Frankly again.
<k>
<p>
It's OK, we have to let him
know what Princess Peach
wrote in her e-mail anyway...
<k> mac_3_001_nok That's the fourth Crystal
Star, all right.<wait 250> Professor
Frankly better look at this.
<k>
<p>
Before he does, though, we
oughta let him know what
Princess Peach wrote...
<k> mac_3_001_win That's where the fourth
Crystal Star is,<wait 250> but we'll
need Frankly to translate.
<k>
<p>
I suppose we also should tell
him what Princess Peach
wrote in that recent e-mail...
<k> mac_3_001_yos Hey! That shows where the
fourth Crystal Star is! Can't
that Frankly guy read it?
<k>
<p>
That'd be cool, but first we
better tell him what Princess
Peach's e-mail said, right?!?
<k> mac_4_000_01 <system>
The location of a Crystal
Star has been recorded on
your Magical Map!
<k> mac_4_001_kur Come on!<wait 100> Let's go back to
Professor Frankly's office,
what do you say?
<k>
<p>
We have to tell him about
Princess Peach's e-mail.
<k> mac_4_001_nok Quick! <wait 100>Let's go to the
professor's office.
<k>
<p>
We have to let him know
about Princess Peach's e-mail,
right? Don't we?
<k> mac_4_001_win Quickly, now! <wait 100>Let's go to
the professor's office.
<k>
<p>
We must advise him about
Princess Peach's e-mail!
<k> mac_4_001_yos Quick! <wait 100>Let's cruise up to the
prof's office!
<k>
<p>
We have to tell that guy 
about the princess's e-mail!
<k> mac_4_001_viv We'd better hurry, don't you
think? <wait 100>We should go up to
the professor's office!
<k>
<p>
We have to let him know
about the princess's e-mail!
<k> mac_4_001_chu We must move quickly, love.
<wait 100>
Let's go to the professor's
office, quick as a wink!
<k>
<p>
We have to speak to him of
Princess Peach's e-mail.
<k> mac_5_000_01 <system>
The location of a Crystal
Star was recorded on your
Magical Map!
<k> mac_5_001_kur C'mon!<wait 100> Let's go talk to
Professor Frankly.
<k> mac_5_001_nok All right! <wait 100>Let's go see
the professor.
<k> mac_5_001_win Come, now!<wait 100> Let's go visit
Frankly.
<k> mac_5_001_yos Cool!<wait 100> Let's cruise back and
check in with the prof!
<k> mac_5_001_viv All set? <wait 100>Then let's go see
Professor Frankly.
<k> mac_5_001_bom Right! <wait 100>Let's pop in on that
professor fellow.
<k> mac_5_001_chu OK, then! <wait 100>Now we must go
see Professor Frankly.
<k> mac_6_000_01 <system>
The location of a Crystal
Star was recorded on your
Magical Map!
<k> mac_6_001_kur Uh... <wait 250>OK, that is, like, a TOTAL
typo or something...
<k>
<p>
Do you see that, Mario?
<wait 250>
The last Crystal Star...
<wait 250>
It can't be THERE...
<k> mac_6_001_nok Um...<wait 250> Are my eyes OK?
<k>
<p>
Is it me, or does that show
the last Crystal Star is...
<wait 250>
No... <wait 250>It can't be there...
<k> mac_6_001_win Mmm?<wait 250> Impossible!
<k>
<p>
The last Crystal Star is
all the way up...<wait 250> No!
<wait 250>
I shan't believe it...
<k> mac_6_001_yos Whoa! <wait 250>No way!
<k>
<p>
What's wrong with that map?
<wait 100>
The last Crystal Star is...
<wait 250>
That ain't right!
<k> mac_6_001_viv Hmm? <wait 250>Is that...right?
<k>
<p>
According to the map, the
last Crystal Star is...
<wait 250>
It CAN'T be...
<k> mac_6_001_bom Eh?<wait 100> What's this balderdash?
<k>
<p>
Tell me, old boy, does that
say the last Crystal Star is...
<wait 250>
No. <wait 250>Seems awfully unlikely...
<k> mac_6_001_chu My, my, what's this, now?
<k>
<p>
The last Crystal Star...
<wait 250>
It can't possibly be there...
<k> mac_7_008 <dynamic 3>
What kept you, Mario?!?
</dynamic>
<k>
<p>
...Well, it doesn't matter now. 
<wait 250>
I don't think they're in the
vicinity anymore.

another way to get through
the door...

<wait 250>
Hurry now, Mario!<wait 250> Hold aloft

<k> mac_7_011 At long last, the entrance to
the Palace of Shadow has
been opened!
<k>

Before Princess Peach falls
victim to that fiend... <wait 250>Before
he takes over the world...

<k> tik_07_mail4_01 <housou>
My dear Mario,
I have finally learned what
the legendary treasure is.
<k>
<p>
It is the spirit of a
demon!
<k>
<p>
The X-Nauts plan to revive
this thousand-year-old
monster...
<k>
<p>
And use its power to take
over the world!
<k>
<p>
They're collecting the Crystal
Stars so they can open
the Thousand-Year Door...
<k>
<p>
They'll find this demon's
spirit...
<k>
<p>
But the only thing that can
keep it locked away is the
Crystal Stars themselves!
<k>
<p>
You must not let them get
the Crystal Stars!
<k>
<p>
Please, Mario... You must put
a stop to their horrible plans!
              -Princess Peach-
<k>

<o> stg3_tou_247_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Help the little guy!
Let there be Hot Dogs! stg3_tou_248_kur <p>
I am TOTALLY with you on
this one, Mario.<wait 250> We'll let
you go, little buddy!
<k>
<p>
Is that OK with you, too,
Mr. Hot-Dog-Stand Guy?
<k> stg3_tou_248_nok <p>
Yeah, we can't ignore it...
<wait 250>
Good call, Mario.<wait 250> Let's set
this little guy free.
<k>
<p>
Ummm... <wait 250>Provided that's OK
with you, too, sir.
<k> stg3_tou_248_win <p>
A positively endearing choice,
Mario, not that I expected
any less.<wait 250> We shall free him!
<k>
<p>
You, sir! <wait 250>Mr. Proprietor!<wait 250> 
Would you allow us to free
this poor soul?
<k> stg3_tou_249_kur <p>
Come on, Mario.<wait 250> That's just
tasteless, seriously. <wait 250>Don't
scare the little guy.
<k>
<p>
Try not to be so childish,
will you? <wait 250>There's no choice
here.<wait 250> We'll let him go.
<k>
<p>
Is that OK with you, too,
Mr. Hot-Dog-Stand Guy?
<k> stg3_tou_249_nok <p>
Mario!<wait 250> You're supposed to be
the adult, here!<wait 250> Scaring
babies just plain isn't nice!
<k>
<p>
The way I see it, there's no
two ways about this thing.
<wait 250>
We let this little guy go.
<k>
<p>
Ummm... <wait 250>Provided that's OK
with you, too, sir.
<k> stg3_tou_249_win <p>
Mario, you wash your mouth
out right this instant!<wait 250> How
DARE you frighten this egg!
<k>
<p>
Well, I never... <wait 250>Little eggy,
you just ignore the scary
man, OK?<wait 250> We will let you go.
<k>
<p>
You, sir! <wait 250>Mr. Proprietor!
<wait 250>
Would you allow us to free
this poor soul?
<k> stg3_tou_250 Aww... <wait 100>Fine.<wait 250> Most people don't
like eating stuff that jumps
all over the place, anyway.
<k> stg3_tou_251_kur Awesome! Didja hear that,
little eggy-weggy?!?<wait 250> You're
free!<wait 250> See ya around!
<k> stg3_tou_251_nok Well, cool.<wait 250> Looks like you're
free and clear, little guy.
<wait 250>
'Bye!
<k> stg3_tou_251_win Well, that's just loverly!<wait 250> 
You're free to do whatever
you like, dear egg!<wait 250> Farewell!
<k> stg3_tou_252_kur Huh?<wait 250> What is it now, eggy?
<wait 250>
You want to follow us?<wait 250> 
Is that it?
<k> stg3_tou_252_nok Huh?<wait 250> What's with you now?
<wait 250>
You want to follow us or
something?
<k> stg3_tou_252_win Hmmm?<wait 250> What is it now, dear?
<wait 250>
You wish to accompany us,
you adorable thing?
<k> stg3_tou_253_kur I'm pretty sure our little
buddy here wants to hang
out with us. <wait 250>Do we let him?
<o> stg3_tou_253_nok Ummm... <wait 100>I think he definitely
wants to stick with us.<wait 250> What
should we do, Mario?
<o> stg3_tou_253_win I daresay this little dumpling
wants to stay with us, Mario.<wait 250> 
What shall we do?
<o> stg3_tou_253_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
OK, it can follow us.
No. Jumping eggs bug me. stg3_tou_254_kur <p>
You hear that, little guy?
<wait 300>
Just make sure not to get
in our way, though, OK?
<k> stg3_tou_254_nok <p>
That's great, Mario.<wait 250> You're
in with us, little buddy!
<wait 300>
Stay out of the way, OK?
<k> stg3_tou_254_win <p>
You're all clear, little one!
<wait 300>
But do try not to get
underfoot, all right?
<k> stg3_tou_255_kur <p>
Seriously, Mario, I wonder
about you sometimes.<wait 250> We're
taking him, and that's that.
<k>
<p>
You hear that, little guy?
<wait 300>
Just make sure not to get
in our way, though, OK?
<k> stg3_tou_255_nok <p>
Man! <wait 250>I had heard you were
this nice guy, but...<wait 100>man.<wait 250> Wow.<wait 250> 
Anyway, we gotta take him.
<k>
<p>
Just ignore Mario.<wait 250> You're
in with us, little buddy!
<wait 300>
Stay out of the way, OK?
<k> stg3_tou_255_win <p>
Mario, you awful, awful man.
<wait 250>
Why must you torment him?<wait 250> 
We simply MUST take him in!
<k>
<p>
You're all clear, little one!
<wait 300>
But do try not to get
underfoot, all right?
<k> stg3_tou_297_06 Oh, you're Mr. Gonzales!<wait 250> 
Yeah, that's the mustache
I've been waiting for!
<k> stg3_tou_297_06_01 Actually, you're pretty late...
<wait 250>
Somebody left a package and
a note by the door a bit ago.
<k>
<p>
The letter said: "Look for a
thick-'stached man named
Gonzales and give him this."
<k>
<p>
The "this" the letter was
talking about is...<wait 250>this.
<k> stg3_tou_297_08 So far's I could tell, that
hammer's a new model, the
HAMMAWHACK 2005...
<k>
<p>
Real nice hammer all around.
<wait 250>
Solid craftsmanship, good
grip, high bonkability.
<k>
<p>
The commercials for this
thing say that the hammer
chooses its user...
<k>
<p>
They aren't cheap, either,
so whoever gave this to you
must be a big fan.
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250> Why leave it in this
juice shop?<wait 250> Doesn't that
strike you as a bit odd?
<k>
<p>
I mean, it's not like it's
that hard to hand a gift to
a pro fighter...
<k> stg3_tou_297_09 I still can't get over that
gift from your fan...
<k>
<p>
You're really on your way
now! <wait 250>Getting a stalker's a
big step on the road to fame!
<k> stg3_tou_297_10_kur Mario!<wait 250> ANOTHER e-mail!
<k> stg3_tou_297_10_nok Wow, Mario!<wait 251> E-mails are

<k>
<p>
Sheesh! <wait 250>What next?<wait 250> This
guy's got us running all over!
<wait 250>
It's driving me totally nuts!
<k> stg3_tou_297_29_nok Now we have to go to some
storage room?
<k>
<p>
Man...<wait 250> This seems like a lot
of legwork.<wait 250> Is this guy just
playing with us?
<k> stg3_tou_297_29_win Now we're to break into the
storage room?
<k>
<p>
Mercy!<wait 250> This fellow seems to
like making us run about...
<wait 250>
I can't say I approve.
<k> stg3_tou_297_29_yos What the heck is this guy's
problem? <wait 250>The storage room?
<k>
<p>
I mean...<wait 250> Does he think we
need the exercise?<wait 250> This dude
is really cheesing me off. 
<k> stg3_tou_479_kur Yes!<wait 250> We have three Crystal
Stars now! <wait 250>We're rolling!
<k>
<p>
Let's head back to
Rogueport, Mario!
<k> stg3_tou_479_nok All right! <wait 250>That makes three
Crystal Stars!
<k>
<p>
We'd better get back to
Rogueport, Mario!
<k> stg3_tou_479_win How marvelous! <wait 250>Now we have
three of those Crystal Stars!
<k>
<p>
I suggest we make haste for
Rogueport, wouldn't you say?
<k> stg3_tou_479_yos Sweet!<wait 250> Another Crystal Star!
<wait 250>
That's three, right?
<k>
<p>
We'd better roll back to
Rogueport, don't you think?
<k> stg3_tou_05 Hey there, and welcome!
<wait 250>
Our doors are always open
for thirsty fight fans!
<k>
<p>
So grab a frosty juice,
take a load off, and enjoy!
<k> stg3_tou_06 Hey there, and welcome!
<wait 250>
Our doors are always open
for thirsty fight fans!
<k>
<p>
This'll sound crazy, but I
really wouldn't mind being
the strongest guy alive.
<k>
<p>
I mean, sure, every guy
dreams that once in awhile,
but the thing is, I once...
<wait 250>
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
No, wait... Never mind.
<wait 300>
Good luck out there.
<k> stg7_tou_01 General White?<wait 250> Oh...
<wait 250>
You must mean that white
Bob-omb, huh?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, he used to come here
all the time.
<k>
<p>
But I haven't seen him lately.
<k>
<p>
Now that I think about it,
I think he headed off to
some huge tree...<wait 250>or not.
<k> stg3_tou_re_144 I gotta thank you, buddy!
<wait 250>
Since your run to the top,
business has been booming!
<k>
<p>
I'm looking forward to the
day you make a dramatic
comeback, big guy!
<k> stg3_tou_re_145 You planning on getting
back in the ring?<wait 250> I can't
wait to see your moves NOW!
<k> stg3_tou_re_146 Attaboy, Gonzales!<wait 250> Yeah!
<wait 250>
Back to being champion!
<wait 250>
You're a machine!
<k> stg3_tou_re_146_1 When you're a pro athlete,
you gotta expect some bad
times along with the good.
<k>
<p>
Just take it one step at a
time and you'll be just fine.
<wait 250>
Good luck to you, buddy.
<k> stg3_npc_01_01_01 So this is Glitzville, hmm?
<wait 250>
Not a bad place, if a little
on the tawdry side...
<k>
<p>
Perhaps I'll begin my stay
here with a hostile buyout
of that Hot Dog Stand...
<k> stg3_npc_01_01_02 Ah, you there!<wait 250> Tell me, sir,
do you know the whereabouts
of the Glitz Pit proprietor?
<k>
<p>
Why do I ask?<wait 250> Dear man,
have you seen the crowds?
<wait 250>
This place is a gold mine!
<k>
<p>
I want to sign a plum
sponsorship deal with this
wonderful, vulgar place!
<k> stg3_npc_01_01_03 Well, I've done it.<wait 250> I am now an
official sponsor of the Glitz
Pit. <wait 250>Simply marvelous.
<k>
<p>
But what I do with my scads
of cash is of little import...
<wait 250>
Best of luck to you, sir!
<k> stg3_npc_01_01_04 Why, if it isn't Gonzales!
<wait 250>
I enjoyed your fight earlier!
<wait 250>
Yes, you thrashed that lout!
<k>
<p>
I don't think you're quite
Rawk Hawk caliber, but you
have potential!<wait 250> Keep at it!
<k> stg3_npc_01_01_05 Ah, it's you, Gonzales!
<wait 250>
I should say you have Rawk
Hawk's attention now, hmmm?
<k>
<p>
Yes, I've a feeling you might
just become the champion
one day not long from now!
<k> stg3_npc_01_01_06 The Great Gonzales! <wait 250>Ah!
<wait 250>
Congratulations, Champion!
<wait 250>
A prince among paupers!
<k>
<p>
Keep bringing in crowds like
you have and I'll have to buy
a bank to store my cash!
<k>
<p>
Perhaps you'd like me to
back you as a sponsor, too?
<wait 250>
Not to worry!<wait 250> I have money!
<k> stg3_npc_01_01_07 I see. <wait 400>So. <wait 400>You're leaving.
<wait 250>
Everyone has their reasons.
<wait 250>
That is the way of things. 
<k>
<p>
But hear me:<wait 250> when you do
return, I expect the same
caliber of thrashings, hm?
<k> stg3_npc_01_01_07_1 I should think we'll vacation
here a bit longer...
<k>
<p>
Yes, the air here has a way
of invigorating the lungs and
stirring the wallet.
<k> stg3_npc_01_02_01 I find this floating-city
concept quite fascinating!
<wait 250>
Yes, it intrigues me!
<k>
<p>
I wonder what sort of coinage
one might shell out to build
a vacation home here?
<k> stg3_npc_01_02_02 I must say, I find combat
sports utterly barbarous!
<wait 400>
Oh, I need a hot steam...
<k>
<p>
Are there no saunas here?
<wait 250>
If there aren't, I shall just
have my hubby install one!
<k>
<p>
Excuse me?<wait 250> Installing saunas
on a floating city is against
the fire code?
<k>
<p>
I...<wait 250>did not know that.
<wait 250>
You can't do it? <wait 250>Even for a
disgusting amount of cash?
<k> stg3_npc_01_02_03 This is the first time in my
life I've witnessed combat
sports firsthand...
<k>
<p>
How repugnant! <wait 250>Boorish ogres
grappling about, caterwauling!
<wait 250>
I find it utterly barbarous!
<k> stg3_npc_01_02_04 I can't say I approve of my
little boy Bub witnessing
these violent matches, but...
<k>
<p>
As long as he grows up and
takes over the Golbobbington
Corporation, I can't complain.
<k> stg3_npc_01_02_05 Combat sports do SO repel
me, but my dear Bub WILL
be a corporate VP one day...
<k>
<p>
I hear those boardrooms can
get quite heated.<wait 250> Perhaps he
SHOULD know self-defense...
<k>
<p>
I wonder if there are any
reputable self-defense tutors
around here...
<k> stg3_npc_01_02_06 You seem a savage sort...
<wait 250>
Would you like to become my
sweet Bub's combat tutor?
<k>
<p>
Fighting is rather low-class,
but the boy will be envied by
all with a pro-champion tutor!
<k> stg3_npc_01_02_07 Oh, is that right? <wait 250>Ah...
<wait 250>
So you plan to travel...
<k>
<p>
I wished to ask you to
consider being Bub's tutor,
but alas...
<k> stg3_npc_01_02_07_1 Oh, is that right? <wait 250>Ah...
<wait 250>
So you plan to travel...
<k>
<p>
I wished to ask you to
consider being Bub's tutor,
but alas...
<k> stg3_npc_01_03_01 Daddy!<wait 250> I'm hungry and I
wanna eat a Hot Dog and
I wanna eat it RIGHT NOW!
<k> stg3_npc_01_03_02 Mommy says the air is thin
here.<wait 250> I think thin air makes
Mommy like to yell.
<k> stg3_npc_01_03_03 Aww...<wait 100>so LAME!<wait 250> This STINKS!
<wait 250>
I really, REALLY wanted to
eat that super-whatever dog!
<k>
<p>
Where else can I get one?
<wait 250>
Daddy! <wait 250>Get me one!
<k> stg3_npc_01_03_04 I want that blimp...<wait 250>and I want
that Hot Dog sign...<wait 250>and I
want that battle poster...
<k> stg3_npc_01_03_05 Hey, I saw you in a fight!
<wait 250>
Yeah!<wait 250> You're real strong!
<wait 250>
My daddy was real happy!
<k>
<p>
People who my daddy likes
become really great, mostly!
<wait 250>
You're gonna be great, too!
<k> stg3_npc_01_03_06 Hey, you became the champ!
<wait 250>
You can come to my house!
<wait 250>
Only celebrities get to visit!
<k> stg3_npc_01_03_07 So are you gonna give up the
champ's belt now or what?
<wait 250>
Can I have it?
<k>
<p>
I told Daddy to buy it for me,
but he said you can't buy a
championship... <wait 250>What a rip.
<k> stg3_npc_01_03_07_1 Hey, you got a pretty cool
life, there.<wait 250> You must make
lots and lots of money.
<k>
<p>
I wonder if I'll have as
cool a life as you do when
I grow up...
<k> stg3_npc_01_04_01 You see that Hot Dog Stand
over there?<wait 250> Best Hot Dog
menu of all time, no joke.
<k>
<p>
Hey, but you look more into
fighting than Hot Dogs... <wait 250>Are
you a pro?<wait 250> I'll root for you!
<k> stg3_npc_01_04_02 Woo!<wait 250> The Great Gonzales!
<wait 250>
You're the coolest ever!
<wait 250>
I root for you all the time!
<k> stg3_npc_01_04_03 I made a couple quick coins
the other day helping the 
juice shop guy fix his roof...
<k>
<p>
But I saw the weirdest design
ever up there... <wait 250>It was this
arrowlike thing...
<k>
<p>
Anyway, I bet you know, but
I did a Spin Jump on that
blue switch to get up there.
<k> stg3_npc_01_04_04 I'm always pulling for you
out there, Gonzales!<wait 250> Yeah!
<wait 250>
Most merciless fighter ever!
<k> stg3_npc_01_04_05 You can probably TASTE that
championship belt, huh?
<wait 250>
I'm pulling for you!
<k> stg3_npc_01_04_06 Congratulations, champ!
<wait 250>
I was with you from day ONE,
Gonzales! <wait 250>I believed!
<k> stg3_npc_01_04_07 The greatest fighter ever...
<wait 250>
The man...<wait 250> Great Gonzales...
<wait 250>
You gotta fight again!
<k>
<p>
I'll wait for your comeback
until the END OF TIME!!!
<k> stg3_npc_re_001 I believed! <wait 250>I believed!
<wait 250>
I knew you'd come back,
Gonzales!<wait 250> I KNEW IT!!!
<k> stg3_npc_re_002 Still the greatest ever!
<wait 250>
The Great Gonzales!<wait 250> Champ!
<wait 250>
That didn't take you long!
<k> stg3_npc_re_002_1 You know, when I see the
Great Gonzales out there
scrapping, I get PUMPED!
<k>
<p>
Just goes to show, you gotta
believe, no matter what!
<wait 250>
Never retire, Gonzales!
<k> stg3_npc_01_05_01 You rode the blimp here,
didn't you?
<k>
<p>
Boy, I envy you.<wait 250> I'm dying to
ride that thing, but air
travel makes me yack.
<k> stg3_npc_01_05_02 It's so sad...<wait 250> I have an
adventurous heart, but a
queasy stomach...
<k> stg3_npc_01_05_03 Unless I cure my airsickness,
I'll be stuck here forever...
<wait 250>
I have to find a way...
<k> stg3_npc_01_05_04 I don't know if you know...
<wait 250>
Besides the airsickness...
<wait 250>
I'm also afraid of heights...
<k> stg3_npc_01_05_05 I wonder...<wait 250> Do you think I can
cure my airsickness by closing
my eyes and chewing gum?
<k> stg3_npc_01_05_06 I've decided! <wait 250>Life's too short!
<wait 250>
Forget this airsickness!
<wait 250>
I'm riding that blimp!
<k>
<p>
<wait 300>
...But...
<k>
<p>
I'm still nervous...<wait 250> I mean,
you can't get off along the
way... <wait 250>Are there parachutes?
<k> stg3_npc_01_05_07 I've decided! <wait 250>Life's too short!

<p>
<wait 300>

"The Worrywart of Glitzville."
<k> stg3_npc_re_004 If they ever make a movie of
my life, it'll be called

<k> stg3_npc_re_004_1 I know it sounds like I'm
exaggerating, but I think
I might never leave here.
<k> stg3_npc_01_06_01 Haven't seen your face
around here...<wait 250>and I know I'd
remember a 'stache like that.
<k>

Listen, guy, if you wanna see
a match, head on inside.
<wait 250>
That's the Glitz Pit.
<k> stg3_npc_01_06_02 What's the word, guy?
<wait 250>
You really think you can
make it as a pro fighter?
<k> stg3_npc_01_06_03 I hear you're pretty good,
guy. <wait 250>Maybe you have a knack
for beating people senseless.
<k> stg3_npc_01_06_04 Wow...<wait 250> I heard the good word,
guy. <wait 250>So, you made it to the
major league, huh?
<k>
<p>
Shoot, if you could make it...
<wait 250>
Maybe I oughta try my hand
in the ring...
<k> stg3_npc_01_06_05 So...<wait 250> I heard you're ranked
pretty high in the major
league these days, guy...
<k>
<p>
Yeah, I definitely have to
look into this pro-fighting
racket. <wait 250>Must be simple...
<k> stg3_npc_01_06_06 You're the champion now?!?
<wait 250>
...Oh, I have GOT to give pro
fighting a shot now.
<k> stg3_npc_01_06_07 Ever hear of fighter's block?
<wait 250>
Someday...<wait 100>you'll realize it's
tough to fight forever. 
<k> stg3_npc_re_005 You're making a comeback?
<wait 250>
I wouldn't even bother, guy.
<wait 250>
Rawk Hawk's invincible now.
<k> stg3_npc_re_006 I gotta admit...<wait 250>that Rawk
Hawk guy was overrated.
<wait 250>
You're the real deal!
<k> stg3_npc_re_006_1 Times always change, guy...
<wait 250>
Today's number one may be
tomorrow's big loser!
<k> stg3_npc_01_07_01 Glitzville hangs out in the
clouds...<wait 250> I'll give you two
guesses why I like it here.
<k> stg3_npc_01_07_02 Y'know, people always accuse
me of having my head in the
clouds, but it's not true.
<k>
<p>
I'm actually quite well
grounded. <wait 250>Just not literally.
<k> stg3_npc_01_07_03 Y'know how they say the
sun hides behind the clouds?
<wait 250>
This "son" does that too!
<k> stg3_npc_01_07_04 See the sunglasses my bud
has on?<wait 250> They're prescription.
<wait 250>
He has cloudy vision!
<k> stg3_npc_01_07_05 I know I have goggles on, but
my eyesight is 20/20.<wait 250> They're
what you call "fashion."
<k> stg3_npc_01_07_06 A lot of Lakitus tell me that
I seem very down-to-earth.
<wait 250>
Is that an insult or what?
<k> stg3_npc_01_07_07 I used to try to trick people
into thinking I could tell
their fortunes...
<k>
<p>
I'd be like: "Dark clouds
are massing on the horizon."
<wait 250>
Heh heh heh... <wait 250>Awesome.
<k> stg3_npc_re_007 Most people get sad when
it's cloudy out, but not me...
<wait 250>
I'm cloudy every day!
<k> stg3_npc_re_008 Hey, I'm a pretty good
storyteller, don't you think?
<wait 250>
Yeah, I want to be a writer...
<k>
<p>

<k> stg3_npc_01_11_01 That fabulous mustache...
<wait 250>
I've seen it somewhere
before, I know it...
<k>
<p>
Yes... <wait 250>Mario...<wait 250> That is
definitely a name I've heard
somewhere before...
<k> stg3_npc_01_11_02 The champion... <wait 250>Rawk Hawk...
<wait 250>
He's showy, but all that
sparkles is not gold, they say.
<k>
<p>
Perhaps you know, but he is
actually the second champion
of the Glitz Pit...
<k>
<p>
The sparkle of the first
champion...<wait 250> Prince Mush...
<wait 250>
Now THAT was real...
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250> Such a tragedy...
<wait 250>
Prince Mush disappeared,
never to return...
<k>
<p>
Many still believe Prince
Mush may make a magnificent
comeback someday...
<k> stg3_npc_01_11_03 Prince Mush... <wait 250>The first Glitz
Pit champion... <wait 250>The fighter
long since lost...
<k>
<p>
He shone truly and brightly.
<wait 250>
Many fans still hope that
he may dramatically return...
<k>
<p>
Of course, I'm one of them...
<wait 250>
I long to see the poetry of
his pure fighting style...
<k> stg3_npc_01_11_04 Watching you fight...<wait 250> You
remind me of the first
champion, Prince Mush...
<k> stg3_npc_01_11_05 Gonzales... <wait 250>It seems that no
fighter can stop your
momentum...
<k>
<p>
Your run reminds me of the
glory days of Prince Mush,
the first Glitz Pit champion... 
<k> stg3_npc_01_11_06 The third Glitz Pit champion...
<wait 250>
The Great Gonzales...
<wait 250>
Congratulations.
<k>
<p>
I very much wish to see...
<wait 250>
In fact, I'm sure EVERYONE
would love to see...
<k>
<p>
The spectacle of you facing
off with the first champion,
Prince Mush...
<k> stg3_npc_01_11_07 Thank you, Great Gonzales...
<wait 250>
No, thank you, MARIO...
<k>
<p>
You're a true champion.
<wait 250>
Huh?<wait 250> Who am I, you ask?
<k>
<p>
Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm!
<wait 250>
You don't know?<wait 250> I'm someone
you know quite well, actually.
<k>
<p>
When I go outside the arena,
I like to cut loose and shed
my other personality...
<k> stg3_npc_re_015 Welcome back, Gonzales...
<wait 250>
Everyone's been all atwitter
waiting for your return...
<k>
<p>
We've all missed your
fabulous moves...
<k> stg3_npc_re_016 Just what I'd expect from a
legendary Glitz Pit champion...
<wait 250>
An overwhelming win...
<k>
<p>
I'm sure Prince Mush was
duly impressed with your
win, as well...
<k>
<p>
Yes, young Mush is doing
quite well, all thanks to
you.<wait 250> Thank you, Mario...
<k> stg3_npc_re_016_1 The beauty of a win streak...
<wait 250>
The beauty of battling on...
<wait 250>
The beauty of not giving up...
<k>
<p>
What we do in a battle is an
echo of what we do in life...
<wait 250>
Don't forget that...

<wait 250>
Nice meeting you.
<k> stg3_npc_01_13_02 Hey, what's shaking, dude?
<k>
<p>
I heard you're fighting.
<wait 250>
Here's hoping you can become
a star like Prince Mush!
<k> stg3_npc_01_13_03 You wanna know something?
<wait 250>
That Rawk Hawk is actually
a total coward, dude.
<k>
<p>
I heard this rumor that he
rigged his fight with Prince
Mush to make him withdraw.
<k> stg3_npc_01_13_04 Hey, what's shaking, dude?
<wait 250>
Keep it clean out there, OK?
<wait 250>
Prince Mush always did...
<k> stg3_npc_01_13_05 Hey, what's shaking, dude?
<wait 250>
Knock some heads today, OK?
<wait 250>
Prince Mush always did...
<k> stg3_npc_01_13_06 Hey, what's shaking, Champ?
<wait 250>
Know what? <wait 250>You may even be
stronger than Prince Mush!
<k> stg3_npc_01_13_07 Hey, what's shaking, Champ?
<wait 250>
I can't believe you aren't
gonna be in the Pit anymore...
<k> stg3_npc_re_019 Hey, what's shaking, Champ?
<wait 250>
Welcome back, dude! <wait 250>Ready

<k> stg3_npc_re_020 Hey, what's shaking, Champ?
<wait 250>
Your name's gonna live

<k> stg3_npc_re_020_1 Hey, what's shaking, Champ?
<wait 250>
You're always the champ to
me, no matter what.
<k> stg3_npc_01_14_01 Today's main event will rule!
<wait 250>
I'm betting on Rawk Hawk, no
matter who's fighting him!
<k>  stg3_npc_01_14_02 Hey, Gonzales. <wait 250>Wassup?
<wait 250>
Go knock yourself out, man!
<k> stg3_npc_01_14_03 Huh? <wait 250>The Great Gonzales? 
<wait 250>
No offense, man, but I don't
follow minor-leaguers.
<k> stg3_npc_01_14_04 I could use a couple extra
coins...<wait 250>so I'll just bet on
Rawk Hawk again!
<k>
<p>
Rawk Hawk will never lose...
<wait 250>
unless Prince Mush suddenly
appears, and that ain't likely!
<k> stg3_npc_01_14_05 Gonzales!<wait 250> I gotta tell you,
man, even if you challenge
the champion...
<k>
<p>
I'm still betting the farm
on Rawk Hawk!<wait 250> 'Cause that
guy is unstoppable!
<k> stg3_npc_01_14_06 Big, bad Great Gonzales!
<wait 250>
I gotta thank you, man!
<wait 250>
I made a killing on you!
<k>
<p>
What?<wait 250> Rawk Hawk? <wait 250>Who, me?
<wait 250>
What are you talking about?
<wait 250>
I've always been YOUR fan!
<k> stg3_npc_01_14_07 If you're out of the picture,
Rawk Hawk will reign again!
<wait 250>
I'll be betting on him!
<k> stg3_npc_re_021 You came back? <wait 250>Wow, man!
<wait 250>
But even you can't beat the
new, improved Rawk Hawk!
<k> stg3_npc_re_022 You still got it, man!
<wait 250>
I made a fortune betting on
you, Gonzales!
<k>
<p>
Huh? <wait 250>Rawk Hawk?<wait 250> Who, me?
<wait 250>
Are you crazy? <wait 250>I've always
been a Gonzales man!
<k> stg3_npc_re_022_1 If you always bet the
favorite, you win a whole lot,
even if you don't win much.
<k>
<p>
So, you'll know you made it
big if I start betting on
you, buddy!

I forgot the code for the

<p>
And the prototype of our

<k>
<p>
If I don't figure out how to

About that briefcase code...
<wait 250>
See, I'm a real chair fanatic...
<wait 250>
Yeah, like anything you sit on.
<k>
<p>
I used the number of chairs
in the houses I visited on
business as the code.
<k>
<p>
Don't judge me, I know it's
weird. <wait 250>You gotta visit those
places and count the chairs!
<k>
<p>
The code has four digits.
<wait 250>
So here are the locations of
the chairs:<wait 250> ready?
<k>

The first is Kroop's house

Oh, and I counted the

match, head on through
those main doors.
<k> stg3_tou_33_kur What do you think we oughta
do?<wait 250> We can't just steal
that nutcase's belt, can we?
<k>
<p>
This stinks.<wait 250> What do we do?
<o> stg3_tou_33_nok Boy... <wait 250>I don't know, Mario.
<wait 250>
It's not like we can just
steal that guy's belt...
<k>
<p>
...Or can we?<wait 250> What should be
our move here?
<o> stg3_tou_33_win Oh, whatever shall we do?
<wait 250>
I don't fancy the idea of
stealing that fellow's belt...
<k>
<p>
What shall we do, Mario?
<o> stg3_tou_33_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Steal that thing!
Battle our way to the top! stg3_tou_34_kur <p>
Come on, Mario.<wait 250> Seriously.<wait 250> 
We're the good guys, here.
<wait 250>
We can't do that.
<k>
<p>
No, no, the way I see it,
<wait 250>
our only option is...
<k>
<p>
For you to kick some tails,
take some names, become the
champ, and WIN that belt!
<k> stg3_tou_34_nok <p>
Ummm... <wait 100>Listen, Mario, I think
the world of you, but really...
<wait 250>
We can't do that.
<k>
<p>
It just wouldn't be right.
<wait 250>
The way I see it, we have
no choice...
<k>
<p>
You gotta fight your way to
the top and win that belt
fair and square!
<k> stg3_tou_34_win <p>
Oh, Mario, you adorable
man!<wait 100> You do love to joke!
<wait 250>
We'll do no such thing.
<k>
<p>
I must say, I only see one
way to get what we seek.
<wait 250>
Yes, just one...
<k>
<p>
You must best this champion
and take the belt with the
power of your machismo!
<k> stg3_tou_35_kur <p>
There you go!<wait 250> You and I are,
like, TOTALLY on the same
exact wavelength!
<k>
<p>
Crack a few heads, take a
few names, become champ,
and nab that belt!
<k> stg3_tou_35_nok <p>
That's the ticket, Mario!<wait 250> 
Do this thing RIGHT!
<k>
<p>
All you have to do is become
champ and you'll get that
belt fair and square!
<k> stg3_tou_35_win <p>
Oh, you darling man, I'm SO
happy to hear you say that!<wait 250> 
I'd expect nothing less!
<k>
<p>
You're ten times the man of
anyone here! <wait 100>You'll be
champion in no time! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k> stg3_tou_36_kur So let's get busy, huh?
<wait 250>
I guess we gotta become
official battlers first, right?
<k>
<p>
Ooh, I'm kinda getting stoked
about this!<wait 250> Let's go find
out who runs this shindig!
<k> stg3_tou_36_nok So...I guess we better get
started.<wait 250> There must be a
novice sign-up somewhere...
<k>
<p>
My tummy's getting upset...<wait 250> 
Let's find the guy in charge
before I lose my nerve!
<k> stg3_tou_36_win Let's move on then, shall we?
<wait 250>
Our next step is to become
official fighters, I imagine.
<k>
<p>
Ooh, my heart is positively
THUMPING!<wait 250> Let's find whoever
is in charge, this minute!
<k> stg3_tou_37 What's that, bub?<wait 250> You wanna
become a fighter?
<k>
<p>
...Hmmm.<wait 250> Well, if you're serious,
you'd better go meet with
Mr. Grubba, the promoter.
<k>
<p>
Mr. Grubba's office is just
down the hallway.<wait 250> You can't
miss it.
<k>
<p>
Head on through.

you gotta meet Mr. Grubba,

I dunno if you know this, but
Ms. Jolene is the fight
promoter now.
<k>
<p>
If you have business with her,
head on down the hallway to
the promoter's office, OK?
<k>
<p>

comeback?<wait 250> 'Cause that would

<k> stg3_tou_479_00_03 Gonzales, I wanna tell you...
<wait 250>
Rawk Hawk ain't gonna fight
dirty anymore.
<k>
<p>
I'm gonna hit the weights,
take some vitamins, and win
the title fair and square!
<k>
<p>
And I'm never, EVER gonna
lose again! <wait 250>Remember: <wait 100>when

<k> stg3_tou_479_00_04 Listen, G-money...
<wait 250>
Thanks for everything, man.
<k>
<p>
You're the nicest dude I ever

I got your back.
<k>
<p>
Me, I think I'm gonna chill
here and improve my skills.
<wait 250>
King K's back, baby!
<k>
<p>
And it's all thanks to you,

<k> stg3_tou_479_00_05 Now that Grubba's out of the
picture, I'm going to take
over running the Glitz Pit.
<k>
<p>
If you ever decide to return
to the ring, just come back!
<wait 250>
I'll keep your spot open.
<k>
<p>
You have tons of fans, and
they'd absolutely love it
if you made a comeback!
<k>
<p>
Anyway, think it over, OK?
<wait 250>
And travel safe!
<k> stg3_npc_02_01_01 Well, hello there, you big,
burly hunk of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're smashing, dear.
<k>
<p>
But I'm afraid I'm only
interested in the champion,
Rawk Hawk. <wait 250>Toodle-oo!
<k> stg3_npc_02_01_02 Well, hello there, you fine,
sweaty stallion of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're marvelous, dear.
<k>
<p>
But I'm afraid I'm only
interested in the champion,
Rawk Hawk. <wait 250>Toodle-oo!
<k> stg3_npc_02_01_03 Well, hello there, you great,
beefy bull of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're wonderful, dear.
<k>
<p>
But I'm afraid the only man
for me is the champion,
that hirsute Rawk Hawk.
<k>
<p>
By which I mean, the minimum
requirement to date me is a
champ's belt, you poor thing.
<k> stg3_npc_02_01_04 Well, hello there, you hardy,
heroic he-man of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're lovely, dear.
<k>
<p>
The gossips have it that
you've made some headway
in the major league...
<k>
<p>
But I doubt you can beat
Rawk Hawk, you poor thing.
<wait 250>
You're simply too stringy.
<k>
<p>
The only man for me is the
one wearing that shiny belt...
<wait 250>
Toodle-oo!
<k> stg3_npc_02_01_05 Well, hello there, you large,
lovely tiger of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're fantastic, dear.

you've made some headway

<k>
<p>
The only man for me is the

<wait 250>
Toodle-oo!
<k> stg3_npc_02_01_06 Well, hello there, you bold,
brave brute of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're a wonder, dear.
<k>
<p>
There's only one woman for
you, the champion, and that
is...<wait 250>me, of course!
<k>
<p>
Yes, it's quite an honor, as
I would ONLY date a champ...
<wait 250>
Toodle-oo!
<k> stg3_npc_02_01_07 Well, hello there, you savage,
surly stud of a man, you.
<wait 250>
You're fabulous, dear.
<k>
<p>
Pardon me?<wait 250> You quit being
the champion?<wait 250> Whatever for?
<wait 250>
...What a shame.
<k>
<p>
Then I'm afraid I have no
need for you anymore.
<k>
<p>
Soon I'll have myself a new
champion, don't you worry!
<wait 250>
Toodle-oo!
<k> stg3_npc_02_02_01 Yo!<wait 250> Outta the way, pal!
<wait 250>
I don't do stories on nobodies,

<k> stg3_npc_02_02_02 Huh? <wait 250>The Great Gonzales?
<wait 250>
I don't cover minor-leaguers.
<wait 250>
Clear outta the way!
<k> stg3_npc_02_02_03 Huh?<wait 250> The Great Gonzales?
<wait 250>
You're a minor-leaguer and
your nickname is "Great"?<wait 250> Ha!
<k> stg3_npc_02_02_04 Yo!<wait 250> Yo! <wait 250>Great Gonzales!
<wait 250>
Two questions!
<k>
<p>
How are you feeling today,
and if you were a soda pop,
what flavor would you be?
<k> stg3_npc_02_02_05 Yo!<wait 250> Yo! <wait 250>Great Gonzales!
<wait 250>
Two questions!
<k>
<p>
How's your mind state, and
if you were a jungle animal,
what noise would you make? 
<k> stg3_npc_02_02_06 Congrats, Great Gonzales!
<wait 250>
You finally got your mitts
on that championship belt!
<k>
<p>
If winning the championship
is like a snack dip, what kind
of tasty chip are you?
<k> stg3_npc_02_02_07 Champion!<wait 250> ...Er, or, I mean...
<wait 250>
Former champion Gonzales!
<wait 250>
Why'd you give up the belt?
<k>
<p>
If giving up the belt is like
a water slide, what kind of
swim trunks do you wear?
<k> stg3_npc_re_023 Yo!<wait 250> Yo! <wait 250>Great Gonzales!
<wait 250>
I hear you've thrown your hat
back into the fighting ring!
<k>
<p>
If your comeback is like a
robot convention, are you an
android or a cyborg?
<k> stg3_npc_re_024 Hooray for Great Gonzales!
<wait 250>
A valiant comeback, and once
more you reign as champ!
<k>
<p>
If regaining the belt is like
a soup, what delicious
ingredient are you?
<k> stg3_npc_re_024_1 Yo!<wait 250> Yo!<wait 250> If you were a
video-game hero, which
hero would you be? 
<k> stg3_npc_02_03_01 Move to one side, small fry!
<wait 250>
The only thing my camera
shoots is famous athletes.
<k> stg3_npc_02_03_02 Move aside, you wanna-be!
<wait 250>
My camera settings can't
process minor-leaguers.
<k> stg3_npc_02_03_03 Move aside, you wanna-be!

Prince Mush in his prime!

<wait 250>
I'll be looking for it!

<p>
We can be champs again!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is the Glitz Pit lobby.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
It's pretty nice, actually!
<wait 250>
Sturdily built, nice decor.
<k>
<p>
And what can you say about
that luxurious chandelier
except...<wait 300>FABULOUS!!!
<k> ガードマン１ <keyxon>
This guy is Glitz Pit Security.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He has to keep watch on this
particular area.
<k>
<p>
You can tell this guy works
out all the time. <wait 250>I bet he's
buffer than the fighters.
<k> ガードマン２ <keyxon>
This guy is Glitz Pit Security.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He has to keep watch on this

That's Toodles the Toad.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
GOSH, this woman knows how
to dress. <wait 250>I'm SO jealous!
<k>
<p>
Even classy ladies like her
come to watch the fights.
<wait 300>
I guess she likes tough guys...
<k> レポーター <keyxon>
That's a local reporter.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I'm pretty sure he covers the
fight scene.
<k>
<p>
He's such a veteran, he even
directs the rookie cameraman
next to him.
<k> カメラマン１ <keyxon>
That's a local cameraman.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He seems a little flustered.
<k>
<p>
I think he's new at this and
makes lots of mistakes.<wait 250> Just
a guess, though.
<k> カメラマン２ <keyxon>
That's a freelancer.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's always angling for the
next big scoop.
<k>
<p>
We'd better make sure this
guy doesn't shoot us doing
anything...<wait 250>incriminating.
<k> キノピオ４ <keyxon>
That's a Toad who works
here part-time.

<wait 300>
Love that guy!
<k> キノピオ５ <keyxon>
This guy's here with his son.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
I can't tell if he's psyched
to be here with his boy, but...
<k>
<p>
One way or the other, it's
nice to see parents spending
time with their kids.
<k> キノピコ <keyxon>
This kid is still small, but
he's like, the biggest Prince
Mush fan I've ever SEEN!

He's here with his dad.
<wait 300>
It's so CUTE to see kids
and parents having fun!

That's a Toad girl.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She's totally in love with
that Toad guy working here.
<k>
<p>
Her crush is so powerful,
even I'M getting butterflies!
<wait 300>
They'd be so CUTE together!
<k> バッジ屋 <keyxon>
That's Ms. Mowz, the thief.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
She jets off to exotic locales
to hunt for rare badges.
<k>
<p>
The fact that she's here
means the Glitz Pit must
have something special...
<k> チャンピョン <keyxon>
Ah!<wait 250> The champ, Rawk Hawk.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He sure has the star quality
you'd expect from a champ.

But know what?<wait 250> Who cares?
<wait 300>
Everybody knows we're gonna
be the next champions!

<wait 250>
That sparkle's a Crystal Star!

Umm... <wait 100>But that doesn't make
much sense at all.<wait 250> Why would
it be on that guy's belt?
<k> stg3_tou_32_win Yes, I do believe it is!
<wait 250>
That wonderful sparkle is
yet another Crystal Star!

<k>
<p>
Please allow me to offer my
earnest thanks for defeating
that foul Grubba.
<k> stg3_tou_473_03_kur Jolene!
<k> stg3_tou_473_03_nok Ms. Jolene!
<k> stg3_tou_473_03_win Why, Ms. Jolene!
<k> stg3_tou_473_03_yos Jolene!
<k> stg3_tou_473_04 I really have to apologize...
<wait 250>
I'm so sorry that I had to get
you involved...
<k>
<p>
But you must understand...<wait 250> I
had to learn the truth about
this arena by any means.
<k> stg3_tou_473_05 Let me tell you everything.
<k>
<p>
<wait 100>
I had a little brother once,
by the name of Mush. <wait 250>He'd
have done anything for me.
<k>
<p>
Our family was always poor,
so he became a fighter here
to support all of us... 
<k>
<p>
But he suddenly went missing
one day. <wait 250>Our family was
inconsolable.
<k>
<p>
I suspected foul play, so I
got hired on as the manager
and investigated in secret.
<k>
<p>
As I looked for clues about
my brother,<wait 250> I accidentally
saw Mr. Grubba transform.
<k>
<p>
Seeing what I was up against,
I almost gave up hope...<wait 250>and
then you appeared.
<k>
<p>
So I decided to secretly
guide you.
<k> stg3_tou_473_06_kur So, the mysterious X who was
sending those e-mails...
<k> stg3_tou_473_06_nok Ohhh...<wait 250> So, our mysterious X... 
<k> stg3_tou_473_06_win Ah, so our mysterious X was...
<k> stg3_tou_473_06_yos Ah-ha! <wait 250>So, our X buddy was...
<k> stg3_tou_473_07 Correct...<wait 250> It was me.
<k>
<p>
Once I saw you fight, I knew
you were the only one who
could challenge Grubba.
<k> stg3_tou_473_07_01 Now, sir...
<k>
<p>
...No!<wait 250> Not "sir"!<wait 250> Grubba!
<k>
<p>
I want answers, right NOW!
<wait 250>
What did you do with my
precious little brother?
<k>
<p>
<wait 100>
You know exactly what I'm
talking about!<wait 250> The first
champion: <wait 250>PRINCE MUSH!
<k> stg3_tou_473_07_02 Urrrgh...<wait 250> Prince Mush...<wait 250> He...
<wait 500>
He...<wait 250>discovered the secret of
my...<wait 250>power-suckin' machine...
<k>
<p>
I had him...<wait 250>urgh...<wait 250>disappear.
<k>
<p>
Any which way you look at
it...<wait 250>oooog...<wait 250>he ain't around
these parts no more.

<k>
<p>
Oh...<wait 250> Poor, sweet Mush...
<k> stg3_tou_473_07_04_kur Y'know, she came off all
uppity, but she was just a
girl who loved her brother.
<k> stg3_tou_473_07_04_nok Gee... <wait 250>She seemed kind of
aloof, but she really just
loved her brother...
<k> stg3_tou_473_07_04_win The poor dear really seemed
aloof, but in fact, she just
loved her brother so!

mean, but turns out she was

was a dark, dangerous place
seething with conspiracy...

With the help of the lovely
Ms. Jolene, Mario revealed
Grubba's true identity...
<k>
<p>
And acquired the third
Crystal Star by defeating
the monstrous Macho Grubba.
<k>
<p>
Grubba had used the power
of the Crystal Star to run
his power-draining machine...

Trying to strategize for the
fighters is the absolute best!

If I did that, he'd do THAT,

Trying to strategize for the

<k> stg3_tou_127 Real fight fans can read
between the punches to see
the subtleties of pummelings.

Are you tuning me out?
<k> stg3_tou_143 The Goomba Bros. used to
fight fair...but poorly...

Then that long losing streak
changed them for the worse.
<k> stg3_tou_144 I used to be a fighter here.
<k>
<p>
Hey there, Gonzales.
<wait 250>
You think you can be champ?
<o> stg3_tou_145 There's a phone booth in
Glitzville, you know.

<p>
Hey, Champ...<wait 250> Any idea why
phone booths are always
see-through?
<o> stg3_tou_146 You havin' fun?

Just bein' unbeatable doesn't
make you a champion.

climb the ranks!

<k> stg3_tou_160 Fans and fighters are after
different things, but desire
comes from the same place.
<k> stg3_tou_161 Who do you root for?
<wait 250>
I'm an Adonis Twins fan!

They've got invincible bodies
and super-sharp spikes!
<wait 250>
They're the best!
<k> stg3_tou_162 You're a fighter, right?
<wait 250>
Why don't ya get some spikes
like the Iron Adonis Twins?
<k>
<p>
I bet that would help!
<wait 250>
Yeah, do it!
<k> stg3_tou_163 Watching that fight with
Rawk Hawk totally moved me!

I'm your biggest fan.

I'll be at your next match,

<k> stg3_tou_164 Everybody wants their
favorite fighter to win.

But these fans would never
get into the ring for fear
of getting hurt.<wait 250> Me neither.
<k> stg3_tou_165 You're a new competitor,
right?<wait 250> Well, good luck.
<k>
<p>
But don't get any ideas...
<wait 250>
Because you'll never beat
Rawk Hawk.
<k> stg3_tou_166 I think that watching you
fight has actually changed
people's lives.
<k>
<p>
Like me! <wait 250>I've decided to
become a stronger person!
<k> stg3_tou_167 Catch the GLISPO today?

You're really something!
<wait 250>
What?<wait 250> Ha ha... <wait 250>Nothing...

better run home and wrestle
your cat!

By the way, great costume!
<wait 250>
Where'd you get that hat?
<wait 250>
It looks just like his!
<k> stg3_tou_173 That looks painful...
<k> stg3_tou_174 I wonder if you'll end up
like that someday?
<k> stg3_tou_175 I believe everything I read
in GLISPO.<wait 250> Because I am very,
very stupid.
<k> stg3_tou_176 I don't wanna end up like
that, no sir.
<k> stg3_tou_177 Time is money, man.

This is the Glitz Pit itself!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
That's the ring in the middle.
<k>
<p>
That's where all the magic
happens. <wait 250>And by "magic,"
I mean brutal beatdowns.
<k>  

stg3_tou_62 As you know, you are a
contracted fighter now, so
you must abide by some rules.
<k>
<p>
First and foremost, what Mr.
Grubba says, goes.<wait 250> Period.
<wait 250>
You must do what he says.
<k>
<p>
Also, as per your contract,
you cannot quit until Mr.
Grubba releases you.
<k>
<p>
There are many other small
guidelines that I will explain
as they become relevant.
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_00 Hey there, Gonzales.
<wait 250>
How's it going?
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_01 Me?<wait 250> I'm doing a little...
<wait 250>
research.
<k>
<p>
Hey, speaking of which...
<wait 250>
Ever hear of the "Seven
Wonders of the Glitz Pit"?
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_02 Yes, this place has rumors
and secrets in spades, but...
<k>
<p>
The Seven Wonders of the
Glitz Pit are the most
mysterious of the bunch.
<k>
<p>
These things fascinate me,
so I wander around doing
research on them.
<k>
<p>
Well? <wait 250>So, how about it?
<wait 250>
Want to hear about the
Seven Wonders or not?
<o> stg3_tou_hushigi_02_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Sure!
Nah... stg3_tou_hushigi_03 Hey there, Gonzales.
<wait 250>
How's it going?
<k>
<p>
You're looking curious...
<wait 250>
Want to hear about the
Seven Wonders?
<o> stg3_tou_hushigi_04 One of the Seven Wonders
of the Arena...<wait 250> I think I'm
getting close to it now...
<k>
<p>
Oh, hey, speaking of which...
<wait 250>
You want to hear about the
Seven Wonders of the Arena?
<o> stg3_tou_hushigi_05 <p>
Heh heh heh heh heh!
<wait 250>
Let's see...<wait 250> Which one do you
want to hear about?
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_list_1 The Sealed Wall stg3_tou_hushigi_list_2 The Man-Eating Toilet stg3_tou_hushigi_list_3 The Stairs of Mystery stg3_tou_hushigi_list_4 The Haunted Boudoir stg3_tou_hushigi_list_5 The Spooky Ring-Lights stg3_tou_hushigi_list_6 The Missing Ones stg3_tou_hushigi_list_7 Grubba and Jolene stg3_tou_hushigi_06 <p>
You know, it's possible that
the Seven Wonders are just
gossip and rumors...
<k>
<p>
But I've got to tell you...
<wait 250>
I think they're real, and
I think they're sketchy.
<k>
<p>
I smell a rat behind all of
this, and someday, I'll solve
ALL of these mysteries.
<k>
<p>
Hey, if you ever want to
hear more about this stuff,
just say the word, OK?
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_07 <p>
Oh, yeah?<wait 250> Fine, whatever.
<wait 250>
If you ever want to learn
some stuff, just holler.
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_08 If you ever want to learn
some stuff, just holler.
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_09 He he he.
<wait 250>
It wouldn't be fun telling you everything all at once.
<k>
<p>
I will tell you a new story as your ranking goes up a notch.
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_11 They say...<wait 250>there's a sealed
wall in the minor-league
locker room...
<k>
<p>
Some say...the remains of
fallen athletes are stored
in there...
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_12 They say...<wait 250>in one of the
arena's bathrooms, a
man-eating toilet lurks...
<k>
<p>
Some say...<wait 250>that anyone who
sees this toilet never sees
anything again...
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_13 They say...<wait 250>there's a room in
the Glitz Pit with a second
floor but no stairs...
<k>
<p>
They say...<wait 250>no one has ever
gone upstairs...
<k>
<p>
And some say...<wait 250>that groaning
voices sometimes come from
that second floor...
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_14 They say...<wait 250>that the
champion's room is haunted...
<k>
<p>
Some say...<wait 250>if you keep still in
the room, you'll hear voices
whispering from nowhere.
<k>
<p>
Some even say...<wait 250>the voices
are athletes who lost to
the champion...
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_15 My friend's friend's friend
told me this one...
<k>
<p>
He said...<wait 250>he saw a strange
light leaking under the ring
doors when no one was there.
<k>
<p>
He couldn't see inside since
the doors were locked.<wait 250> I plan
to investigate this myself...
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_16 They say...<wait 250>sometimes fighters
disappear for no reason,
never to return...
<k>
<p>
Some say...<wait 250>that the very first
champion, Prince Mush, was
spirited away in this way...
<k> stg3_tou_hushigi_17 Grubba is a strange one...
<wait 250>
His body is incredibly toned,
even though he's past 60.
<k>
<p>
He must have an exceptional
training regimen.
<k>
<p>
Then, there's the matter of
Ms. Jolene.
<k>
<p>
They say...<wait 250>she suddenly
vanishes at times.
<k>
<p>
Some say...<wait 250>a fighter saw her
go into the bathroom and
waited for her to come out.
<k>
<p>
...But she never did.
<k>
<p>
...Huh?<wait 250> You think it's stranger
that someone staked out
her bathroom? <wait 250>Good point.
<k> stg3_tou_240_02 So you're telling me that you
have no idea who got inside?
<wait 250>
What do we pay you for? 
<k> stg3_tou_240_03 I'm awful sorry, Ms. Jolene.
<wait 250>
I heard a noise in there, but
I couldn't find nothing...
<k> stg3_tou_240_04 Hmph. <wait 250>Fine, leave the rest of
this matter to me.<wait 250> Go back
to your post.
<k>
<p>
And listen to me carefully:
<wait 250>
do not EVER tell anyone of
this or I'll have your job.
<k> stg3_tou_240_05 You!<wait 250> Mr. Gonzales, this is
highly inappropriate!<wait 250> What
business do you have here?
<k>
<p>
Please, I must ask you to
stay out of places where you
have no business being.
<k> stg3_tou_297_13 Ah.<wait 250> Gonzales, isn't it?
<k>
<p>
I got the word that you
wanted to move back down
to the minor league again.
<k>
<p>
Can't say I understand why.<wait 250> 
Anyway, go on in.
<k> stg3_tou_297_27_00 Gonzales!
<k>
<p>
Good timing, you pudgy little
punk.<wait 250> Uncle Rawk Hawk's got
some advice for ya.
<k>
<p>
If you keep stealing the
spotlight from me, you're
gonna enter a world of hurt!
<k>
<p>
Quit making such a splash,
if you value your puny life!
<wait 250><shake>

he threaten us like that?
<wait 250>
Talk about low-class!
<k>
<p>
Wait...<wait 100> He threatened us!
<wait 250>
You think that hate mail
came from old chicken-legs?
<k>
<p>
Well, who knows?<wait 250> One thing's
for sure: <wait 100>we gotta watch our
step from here on out.
<k> stg3_tou_297_27_01_nok Hey! <wait 250>Who does that guy think
he is, threatening us?
<k>
<p>
But wait... <wait 250>Threatening us...
<wait 250>
Maybe that hate mail came
from Rawk Hawk!
<k>
<p>
Well, one way or the other,
we need to be really careful
from now on.
<k> stg3_tou_297_27_01_win That chicken is rather rude.
<wait 250>
I hardly think it's necessary
to resort to threats...
<k>
<p>
But wait a moment...
<wait 250>
Could it be that the nasty
e-mail came from him?
<k>
<p>
I suppose we can't know.
<wait 250>
And regardless of who sent
it, we must be more careful.
<k> stg3_tou_297_27_01_yos Yeah, you BETTER keep
walking, you punk chicken!
<wait 250>
YOU HEAR ME TALKING?!?
<k>
<p>
Hey! <wait 250>Wait! <wait 250>I wonder...
<wait 250>
You think THAT idiot sent
us that hate mail?
<k>
<p>
<p>
I guess it doesn't matter.
SOMEBODY hates us, so we
better watch our steps.
<k> stg3_tou_407_kur Hey! Where do you think
YOU'RE going, pal?<wait 250> Huh?
<wait 250>
The ring's this way!
<k> stg3_tou_407_nok Ummm...<wait 250> Mr. Security Guy?
<wait 250>

believe you're taking us
the wrong way...
<k> stg3_tou_407_yos Hold up, dude!<wait 250> Where are
you heading? <wait 250>That ain't the
way to the arena!
<k> stg3_tou_408 Yeah, uh, you go this way
this time 'cause it's a
special match.
<k> stg3_tou_408_01_kur Slow down, will ya, buddy?
<wait 250>

<k> stg3_tou_408_01_win Sir, I really must protest...
<wait 250>
Where are we off to?
<k> stg3_tou_408_01_yos Hey, hold it, meathead!

<k> stg3_tou_423_01 You're late, Mr. Gonzales.

<wait 250>

<wait 400>
How dare you say that!
<wait 250>
I did NOT trick you!
<k>
<p>
I have no idea what you're
talking about, but you'd
better check yourself.
<k> stg3_tou_423_03 Pardon me?<wait 250> Mr. Gonzales,

entrance on the other side.

stg3_tou_43 Who in tarnation are you,
son?<wait 100> And who let you in?!?
<wait 500>
This is Grubba's office!
<k>
<p>
Yep, that's me, Grubba!<wait 250> 
An' you, yer one rude dude, 
comin' in without knockin'!
<k> stg3_tou_44 What, now? <wait 250>An athlete, huh? 
<wait 250>
You wanna be a fighter?
<k> stg3_tou_45 Hoo-WEE!<wait 250> That do change a
thing or two, son!<wait 250> I always
got time for an up-an'-comer!
<k>
<p>
Yep, this place is packed to
the gills with young fighters,
all primed and a-rarin' to go!
<k>
<p>
I gotta say, son, yer a bit
skinny fer my tastes, but I'm
willin' to give you a shot.
<k>
<p>
Now, play me straight, son:
<wait 250>
you wanna live the glamorous
life of a champ, don'tcha?
<o> stg3_tou_45_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Darn skippy!
Not particularly. stg3_tou_46_00 <p>
All right!<wait 250> All right, son!
<wait 250>
I hear where yer comin' from,
son, loud an' clear!
<k> stg3_tou_46_00_01 When I was just a poor pup, I
didn't give a Pokey's patoot
for fancy, big-city ways.
<k>
<p>
But I jumped into the world
of martial arts and fought
my way to fame and riches!
<k>
<p>
An' know what I realized?
<wait 250>
Bein' rich an' famous is
diggety-dang DYNAMITE!  
<k> stg3_tou_46_01 Now, I can't mix it up in the
ring no more, but I earned
enough to set me for life.
<k>
<p>
You readin' me here, son?
<wait 250>
Dreams do come true, even if
they ain't yours, exactly!
<k> stg3_tou_46_02 Yep, that's the key, son!
<wait 250>
Dream big, and you'll GET big,
that's the winner's way!
<k> stg3_tou_46_03 And when you make it big,
you'll look back at all those
small-dreamers and LAUGH! 
<k>
<p>
You readin' me here, son?
<k> stg3_tou_47 That's the spirit, chief!
<wait 250>
Here, let's have us a little
walk 'n' talk.<wait 250> C'mon, now!
<k> stg3_tou_51 Now...<wait 250> I'm sure you know this
already, son, but there ain't
but one world champion.
<k>
<p>
Clawin' your way to the top
an' takin' the belt to become
champ ain't an easy thing...
<k>
<p>
But that's the point, son!
<wait 250>
Wouldn't be worth it if there
weren't no challenge!
<k>
<p>
I can see you got the fire
for it, too, pard!<wait 250> You got
the eye of the tiger, there!
<k>
<p>
Yer gonna be champ, I can
just FEEL it! <wait 250>I ain't never
been so sure about a fighter!
<k> stg3_tou_52 Oh, hey, one other thing...
<k>
<p>
You gotta sign a itty-bitty
contract to be a fighter.
<k>
<p>
It ain't no thing, just take a
second or two of yer time.
<wait 250>
Just jot your name here, OK?
<o> stg3_tou_52_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Sign me up!
I don't think so. stg3_tou_53 <p>
What in the hey?<wait 250> You lose
yer taste for glory, son?
<k>
<p>
Well, I can't say I understand
yer change of heart, but...
<wait 250>
ain't nothin' I can do.
<k>
<p>
I like yer style, though, so
if you ever change yer mind...
<wait 250>
Just come on back, you hear?
<k> stg3_tou_54 Hey, it's the future champ!
<wait 250>
So, you got yer nerve back
up, did you, son?
<k>
<p>
All right, then: how about you
just gimme yer autograph on
this here contract?
<o> stg3_tou_55 <system>

You signed the contract!
<k> stg3_tou_55_01 Best thing you ever done,
son! <wait 400>Now, yer Mario?
<wait 250>
Ain't a bad handle...
<k>
<p>
Still, I gotta say, pard, it
lacks a little punch as a
fighter's name, get me?
<k> stg3_tou_56 Lemme see, here...

<p>
<dynamic 3>
Bam!<wait 100> Hoooooo-WEEEEEEEEE!

<wait 500>

<k> stg3_tou_57 Well, now that we got the
business side outta the way...
<k>
<p>
Jolene? <wait 250>Could you come in
a minute, darlin'?
<k> stg3_tou_58 Yes, sir?<wait 250> You wished to see
me?
<k> stg3_tou_59 Sure did, hon.<wait 250> Jolene, this
is the Great Gonzales, our
newest risin' star.
<k>
<p>
Be a peach and take him on
down to the minor-league
locker room, all righty?
<k> stg3_tou_60 Right away, sir.
<k> stg3_tou_61 Mr. Gonzales?<wait 250> If you would be
so kind, please follow me.
<k> stg3_tou_re_003 Yes, yes, who is it?
<wait 250>
It's customary to knock
before entering...
<k> stg3_tou_re_004 Oh!<wait 250> Why...<wait 250>it's the Great
Gonzales!<wait 250> It's been too long!<wait 250> 
How've you been?
<k> stg3_tou_re_005 I must tell you, we've seen
a big drop-off in attendance
since you returned the belt...
<k>
<p>
I was a touch worried...<wait 250> 
Our financials didn't look
too good for a while, but...
<k>
<p>
Luckily, Rawk Hawk made a
dramatic comeback and is
reigning supreme again.
<k>
<p>
Yes, it's been a whirlwind of
activity every day since I
became a promoter...
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3.0>Wait just a moment!
</dynamic>
<wait 250>
Are you back to fight?!?
<wait 250>
Great Gonzales's return?!?

You must be!<wait 250> Right?
<wait 250>

<wait 250>
Come on!!!<wait 250> Tell me it's true!!!
</dynamic>
<k> stg3_tou_re_005_1 ...What?!?<wait 250> You want to
un-retire and battle again?!?
<k>
<p>
Ah ha ha ha!<wait 250> I always knew
this day would come!
<k> stg3_tou_re_005_1_1 Let me just find your old
registration so we can...
<wait 250>
Huh?
<k> stg3_tou_re_005_2 Ooh. <wait 400>Ouch.<wait 400> I'm so sorry...
<wait 250>
but all of our records of
you seem to be gone...
<k> stg3_tou_re_005_3 ...So our only option, sadly...
<wait 250>
is to start you in the minor
leagues again. <wait 250>Sorry!
<k> stg3_tou_re_006 Sorry, but rules are rules.<wait 250> 
We can't bend them, even for
an ex-champ.
<k> stg3_tou_re_007 I'll just go ahead and put
you on as a minor-league
fighter again, then.
<k>
<p>
When you want to fight, you
know the deal: <wait 100>use the locker
room communicator.
<k>
<p>
I will not be going over the
arena rules again, of course.
<wait 250>
'Bye for now!
<k> stg3_tou_re_008 ...
<k>
<p>
Please, Mr. Gonzales, I'm
very busy these days.<wait 100> Fight
promotion is not easy!
<k>
<p>
Please see yourself out.
<wait 250>
And have a nice day!

Mr. Gonzales, as you

<wait 250>
You mind yer manners, now!
<wait 250>
We KNOCK 'round here, missy!
<k> stg3_tou_289 I apologize, Mr. Grubba.
<k> stg3_tou_290 Don't you worry yer pretty
li'l head about it none.  
<wait 250>
Now, what'd I want again?
<k>
<p>
Somethin' 'bout Gonzales...
<wait 250>
Oh, yeah!
<k> stg3_tou_291 Gonzales, you ol' so-an'-so!
<wait 250>
Lemme congratulate you, son!
<wait 250>
Major league already, huh?
<k>
<p>
I had a feelin' you were

love it when I'm right!
<k>
<p>
You just keep on puttin'
tuckuses in them seats!
<wait 250>

somethin'-somethin' for you.
<wait 250>
Go on!<wait 250> Take it!
<k> stg3_tou_292_02 <system>

You got 30 coins!
<k> stg3_tou_292 So, yeah, somethin' else
that's been on my mind...
<wait 250>
Yer costume ain't cool.
<k>
<p>
No big deal, son, but hey.
<wait 250>
Someday, if you become
champ, I'll get you a new one.
<k>
<p>
Somethin' hot pink, maybe
with some frills or somethin'.
<wait 250>
You'll look a sight, son!
<k>
<p>
Anyway, that's somethin'
fer another day, pard.
<wait 250>
Take a powder, OK?

<wait 750> stg3_tou_316_05 ...So you didn't find hide or 
hair of nobody in the storage
room, that what yer sayin'?
<k> stg3_tou_316_06 Yes, Mr. Grubba.<wait 250> It appeared
to be secure.
<k>
<p>
Don't worry about it, sir.
<wait 250>
I've taken the necessary
precautions.
<k>
<p>
It was most likely just
a rat or something.
<k> stg3_tou_316_07 Well, no big deal either way.
<wait 250>
Ain't nothin' in there we'd
miss too much anyway.
<k>
<p>
Thanks fer stayin' on top of
this, Jolene.<wait 250> Hey, an' by the
way, any word on King K?
<k> stg3_tou_316_08 I'm afraid we still don't know
the whereabouts of King K,
Mr. Grubba.
<k>
<p>
And so...<wait 250> I deleted his spot
on our roster per regulations.
<k>
<p>
The Glitz Pit no longer has
any official connection to
KP Pete, a.k.a. King K.
<k>
<p>
I have, of course, taken the
same steps with all fighters
who have gone missing.
<k> stg3_tou_316_09 Hoo, fighters have sure been
goin' missin' a lot lately!
<wait 250>
That's the fifth this year!
<k>
<p>
What in tarnation's goin' on?
<wait 250>
I even heard some security
ijit sayin' the Pit's cursed!
<k> stg3_tou_316_10 I doubt that, sir, but I
certainly don't understand
the disappearances.
<k> stg3_tou_316_11 Well, fer the time bein', tell
the other fellas that King K
headed on home for a spell.
<k>
<p>
If word gets out about missin'
fighters, it sure ain't gonna
be good for business, no siree!
<k>
<p>
Nasty rumors have a way of
sendin' folks runnin' to the
hills, know what I mean?
<k> stg3_tou_316_12 I understand completely,
Mr. Grubba.<wait 250> I'll take care of
everything, sir.
<k> stg3_tou_316_13 Y'know, Jolene... <wait 250>Yer a dang
fine manager, but you just
plumb disappear sometimes...
<k>
<p>
I gotta know!<wait 250> Where in the
world do you go, darlin'?
<k> stg3_tou_316_14 Uh...<wait 250> Th-That's...
<k>
<p>
Mr. Grubba, I know you're my
boss, but I don't believe
that's any of your business.
<k> stg3_tou_316_15 Easy! <wait 250>Didn't mean to pry,
now! <wait 250>How 'bout this, then...
<wait 250>
Heard of the Crystal Star?
<k> stg3_tou_316_16 <dynamic 3>
!
</dynamic><wait 750>
<p>
N-No...<wait 250> I've never heard of
such a thing, Mr. Grubba.
<k> stg3_tou_316_17 Okeydoke, well, I 'preciate
yer time, Ms. Jolene.
<k>
<p>
You go ahead an' run along,
now, y'hear?
<k> stg3_tou_320 Well, if this ain't a fine how-
do-you-do! Seems like good
fighters are a dyin' breed.
<k>
<p>
That wild child Gonzales is
just about the only draw I
still got 'round here.
<k> stg3_tou_321_kur Pssst! <wait 250>Mario!<wait 250> You listening
to this?!?
<k>
<p>
This whole missing fighter
thing stinks of funny business!
<k>
<p>
And here I just thought that
King K retired and headed
back to his hometown...
<k> stg3_tou_321_nok Mario!<wait 250> Did you get all that?
<k>
<p>
Fighters are going missing!
<wait 250>
Talk about scary!
<k>
<p>
I figured King K just took
an early retirement and
headed home...
<k> stg3_tou_321_win Good gracious me!<wait 250> Did you
hear what I just heard?
<k>
<p>
Missing fighters?<wait 250> How
absolutely heartrending!
<k>
<p>
That poor, sweet King K...
<wait 250>
I just assumed he had
retired to his hometown...
<k> stg3_tou_321_yos Whoa, Gonzales!<wait 250> WHOA!
<wait 250>
Did you hear that?!?
<k>
<p>
Fighters are going missing,
dude! <wait 250>That ain't cool!
<k>
<p>
Was that guy talking about
King K, the minor-leaguer?

<k>
<p>
Did you catch how Grubba
just came out of left field
with that Crystal Star bit?
<k>
<p>
Jolene was acting totally
weird, right?<wait 250> I'm betting
she knows something...
<k>
<p>
Anyway, for now, we'd better
get out of here before
someone finds us.
<k> stg3_tou_326_nok Wow,<wait 250> that was TOO close.
<k>
<p>
So, Mario, you heard that
part about the Crystal Star,
right?
<k>
<p>
Ms. Jolene acted pretty
weird, I thought. <wait 250>Kind of
suspicious...
<k>
<p>
We can look into it later,
I guess. <wait 250>For now, we better
clear out before they find us.
<k> stg3_tou_326_win Mercy!<wait 250> My, that was close!
<k>
<p>
I say, though, Mario, when
that Grubba gentleman spoke
of the Crystal Star...
<k>
<p>
I couldn't help but notice
that Ms. Jolene acted a
touch strange...
<k>
<p>
Well, I do believe that we'd
best make ourselves scarce
before we're found!
<k> stg3_tou_326_yos Whoa! <wait 250>Whoa, man!<wait 250> We dodged
a bullet there!
<k>

Hey, but did you hear that

<p>
That Jolene lady acted
pretty guilty when he let
that one slip out...
<k>
<p>
Well, whatever. <wait 250>For now, we
better bail before somebody
finds us up here!
<k> stg3_tou_456_kur Looks like he's gone...

<p>
Didn't he say something
about his desk drawer?
<k> stg3_tou_456_nok OK... <wait 250>Looks like he's gone.
<k>
<p>
He said something about his
desk drawer, right?
<k> stg3_tou_456_win I do believe he's gone...
<k>
<p>
Now, wasn't there something
in his desk drawer?
<k> stg3_tou_456_yos I think he's gone...
<k>
<p>
Let's check out that desk
drawer of his...
<k> stg3_tou_456_01_kur There's something! <wait 250>You think
that's the paper Grubba hid?

<k> stg3_tou_456_01_nok Hey, see that? <wait 250>I bet that's
the document Grubba hid.
<wait 250>
Let's check it out.

Are you stealing something

Hey, by the way, a security

<wait 250>
Were you making noise?
<k> stg3_tou_309_win Why, if it isn't the young
lady felon! <wait 250>I don't approve of
you following Mario, dear.

I didn't know he hung with

You didn't make just a little
bit of noise, dear?

But you ARE a thief, right?
<k> stg3_tou_312 <se 1>

But whatever...<wait 250> What do you
think she meant about some
poor souls upstairs?
<k> stg3_tou_316_nok Boy, Ms. Mowz sure is cute.
<wait 250>
Too bad I sound like such a
dork whenever I talk to her.

<p>
Hey, but enough of that...
<wait 250>
What was that last thing she
said, about people upstairs?
<k> stg3_tou_316_win Well, I daresay she IS a
thief, hm?<wait 250> She certainly stole
your lips with ease, Mario!
<k>
<p>
But that's hardly important...
<wait 250>
What might she have meant
by "poor souls upstairs"?
<k> stg3_tou_316_yos Well, she took off, huh?
<wait 250>
What was that kiss like?
<wait 250>

seem quite as friendly as

<k> stg3_tou_294_07_kur Sheesh, sorry, Mr. Birdie.
<wait 250>
I didn't mean to say your
belt was fake.<wait 250> Take it easy.
<k> stg3_tou_294_07_nok Ummmm...<wait 100> Gee, sorry, man...
<wait 250>
I didn't mean to insult
your fancy belt, there...
<k> stg3_tou_294_07_win Oh, I do apologize, sir.
<wait 250>
I didn't mean to embarrass
you in front of your belt.
<k> stg3_tou_294_07_yos Whoa, sorry, yellow dude!
<wait 250>
I didn't mean to rip on your
big, bad belt!

Stop making fun of me, punk!

<wait 250>
You're alive ONLY 'cause we

<dynamic 3.0>
Remember the RAWWWWWWK!
<k> stg3_tou_294_09_kur I think I tweaked him out
a little bit.
<k> stg3_tou_294_09_nok Ooooops. <wait 400>I made him mad.
<k> stg3_tou_294_09_win Oh dear, I do believe I
made that chicken angry.
<k> stg3_tou_294_09_yos Wow, I really pushed that
dude's buttons, huh?
<k> stg3_tou_294_10_kur Anyway, we have a problem
now. <wait 250>The map definitely
pointed to Glitzville...
<k>
<p>
If that thing on the champ's
belt ISN'T the Crystal Star,
then...
<k>
<p>
Where the heck is the REAL
one, huh?
<k> stg3_tou_294_10_nok Well, forget him.<wait 250> We have
bigger fish to fry. <wait 250>The map
pointed to Glitzville...
<k>
<p>
But if the gem on that guy's
belt isn't the true Crystal
Star, then...
<k>
<p>
Where's the real one?
<k> stg3_tou_294_10_win In any case, we've larger
issues to deal with.<wait 250> The map
most assuredly pointed here...
<k>
<p>
If the ornament on that
fellow's belt isn't the real
Crystal Star, then...
<k>
<p>
Where in the world could the
real one be?
<k> stg3_tou_294_10_yos Well, forget him!<wait 250> We got a
problem!<wait 250> Your map pointed to
Glitzville, right?
<k>
<p>
If that dude's belt has a
FAKE Crystal Star on it...
<k>
<p>
<p>
Then where the heck is the
real one at?
<k> stg3_tou_294_11_kur Mario!<wait 250> Your Mailbox SP just

<wait 250>
You think he really knows
about the Crystal Star?
<k>
<p>
Whoever he is, why would he
want to give us information?
<wait 250>
I don't trust this guy...
<k> stg3_tou_294_13_nok Um... <wait 100>Who's this X character?
<wait 250>
He talks like he knows all
about the Crystal Star...
<k>
<p>
Why would someone want to
help us with this, anyway?
<wait 250>
Seems kind of fishy...
<k> stg3_tou_294_13_win My! <wait 250>Who is this X fellow?
<wait 250>
He speaks as if he's an
expert on the Crystal Star...
<k>
<p>
What would motivate him to
help us in our quest, though?
<wait 250>
This seems suspicious...
<k> stg3_tou_294_13_yos Who the heck is this X dude?
<wait 250>
He talks like he's the man to
see about that Crystal Star.
<k>
<p>
Why would he wanna help us
out, though? <wait 250>This whole deal
seems kinda wack...
<k> stg3_tou_297_03_kur Whoa! <wait 250>Mario! <wait 250>That was
another e-mail, right?<wait 250> Don't
just stand there, check it!

<k>
<p>
Who in the world is this guy?
<k> stg3_tou_297_05_win Ah, that X fellow again?
<wait 250>
Now he's directing us to
some "watering hole," hmmm?
<k>
<p>
I do wonder who this
gentleman is...
<k> stg3_tou_297_05_yos It's from our mystery X dude?
<wait 250>
Go to some "watering hole,"
huh? <wait 250>OK, whatever!
<k>
<p>
I'd give anything to know who
this dude is.
<k> stg3_tou_297_22_kur Mario!<wait 250> You're like, totally

What's this one?
<k> stg3_tou_297_22_nok Mario!<wait 250> I know that sound!
<wait 250>
I wonder who's e-mailing you

<wait 250>
What now?
<k> stg3_tou_297_23 <housou>
Keep sticking your nose in

you are D-E-A-D M-E-A-T.
<k> stg3_tou_297_24_kur Whoa... <wait 250>That totally sounds
like a threat!<wait 250> I don't think
our X friend sent that one.
<k>
<p>
What kind of psycho would
send hate e-mail like that?
<k> stg3_tou_297_24_nok Oh, gee whiz...<wait 250> That doesn't
sound very nice.<wait 250> And it
doesn't sound like our X.
<k>
<p>
Who in the world would send
a nasty e-mail like that?
<k> stg3_tou_297_24_win Oh, dear... <wait 250>That's a rather
serious threat.<wait 250> I daresay
our X fellow didn't send it.
<k>
<p>
What sort of degenerate
would stoop to such a low?
<k> stg3_tou_297_24_yos Man, THAT dude sounds
peeved! <wait 250>I'm thinking that
isn't our X buddy.
<k>
<p>
Who do you think would
send something like that?
<k> stg3_tou_295 Hey. <wait 250>You.<wait 250> Gonzales.

Well, I suppose we must.

cares?<wait 250> Let's just fight right
back to the top!
<k> stg3_tou_365_viv Ohhh...<wait 100> We lost.<wait 250> Don't worry,
though, we can always fight
back to the top.
<k> stg3_tou_365_bom We lost, eh, mate?<wait 250> No bother.
Let's just fight our way back
to the top, eh?
<k> stg3_tou_365_chu Mmmm... <wait 100>We lost.<wait 250> Don't worry,

<k> stg3_tou_365_03_03_kur We did it, Mario! <wait 250>Sweet!
<wait 250>
We're back in the major
league!<wait 250> Awesome!
<k> stg3_tou_365_03_03_nok Yaaaay!<wait 250> We did it, Mario!
<wait 250>
We're back in the major
league!<wait 250> Cool!
<k> stg3_tou_365_03_03_win Oh, mercy, we've done it!
<wait 250>
We're back in the major
league, Mario!<wait 250> Delightful!
<k> stg3_tou_365_03_03_yos YESSS! <wait 250>We did it, Gonzales!
<wait 250>
We're back in the major
league!<wait 250> Yahoo!
<k> stg3_tou_365_03_03_viv We pulled it off, Mario!

<k> stg3_yado_00 <system>

Do you want to take a rest?
<o> stg3_yado_01 <select 0 1 0 40>
Yes
No stg3_npc_08_01_01 Gonzales. <wait 250>Hear me, now.
<wait 250>
You may have some skill...
<wait 250>
But I'm going to win today!
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_02 You.<wait 250> I underestimated you.
<wait 250>
If you can beat me, you must
be skilled beyond measure.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_03 I laugh at you.<wait 250> Muh huh.
<wait 250>
My victory was clear from
the start.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_04 Destroy the foe before you.
<wait 250>
That is the only concern
of a true warrior.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_05 One's posture in battle is
forged by one's actions in
life. <wait 250>Remember this.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_06 You. <wait 250>Condition yourself for
each and every battle.
<k>
<p>
For anything could happen
beneath the lights...<wait 250> Such
is the way of the warrior.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_07 You. <wait 250>Prepare your body and
mind for every battle.
<wait 250>
Unless you prefer to lose.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_08 Each day dawns, and with it
a new opportunity to hone
my many skills.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_09 Gonzales, I see you have the
gleam of a true warrior in
your eyes now...<wait 250> Never lose it.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_10 You. <wait 250>Gonzales.<wait 250> You are now a
rival worthy of my skills.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_11 I will redouble my training...
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_12 ...............................................
<wait 500>
You.<wait 250> How dare you interfere
with my meditation?
<k>
<p>
Time is too precious to
squander on one such as you.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_13 You. <wait 250>Should you ever face me
again, you will know the pain
of utter defeat.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_13_01 You. <wait 250>Gonzales.<wait 250> Why do you
dally here?<wait 250> Your foe awaits.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_14 Falling to second league is
an embarrassment.<wait 250> You have
neglected your training.
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_15 Don't disappoint me, Gonzales!
<wait 250>
The opponent I've been gunning for wouldn't slide back down like this!
<k> stg3_npc_08_01_16 You. <wait 250>You foul knave.<wait 250> Do you
mock this league by emerging
thus from the toilet?
<k> stg3_npc_re_040 I have waited, Gonzales.
<wait 250>
I knew I would face you in
the ring again one day.
<k> stg3_npc_re_041 I have waited, Gonzales.
<wait 250>
I knew I would face you in
the ring again one day.
<k> stg3_npc_re_041_1 You. <wait 250>Gonzales.<wait 250> Time and again
you rise from the lower
ranks.<wait 250> Commendable.
<k>
<p>
But now, it is over for you.
<wait 250>
Allow me to give you a final
resting place.
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_01 Don't think I'm a pushover
just because I'm small!
<wait 250>
Bring it on!!!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_02 Gosh, you're super-tough!
<wait 300>
But I'll be back, Mister!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_03 I got a lot of power in this
little body, Mister Man!
<wait 250>
Don't go dissing me!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_04 I'll be the champ someday,
you bet!
<k>
<p>
Uh-huh! <wait 250>That's right!<wait 300> Just like
the big, legendary champion,
Prince Mush!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_05 I have a super-hard shell and
a super-sharp spike! <wait 250>Yeah!
<wait 300>
I may be small, but look out!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_06 See this spike on my back?
<wait 250>
Without it, I'd just be an
ordinary Buzzy Beetle!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_07 Don't judge a Buzzy Beetle
by its shell, Mister!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_08 This spike is my trademark,
Mister.<wait 250> Why'd you think they
call me Spiky Joe, anyway?
<k>
<p>
Your trademark must be that
burly mustache, huh?
<k>
<p>
Spiky Joe and Mustache...
<wait 250>
Together they fight crime!
<wait 250>
That'd be a killer TV show!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_09 There's no way a mustache is
better than a spike! <wait 250>I mean,
that's just crazy-talk!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_10 Spikes and mustaches are
both bristly, I guess, but
that's the ONLY similarity...
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_11 When I think something's cool,
I always say it's "spiketastic"!
<wait 400>
...It might catch on.
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_12 Just between you and me...
<wait 250>
Sometimes I have nightmares
that my spike fell off...
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_13 You fight on, Mr. Gonzales!
<wait 250>
I'm gonna keep fighting, too!
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_13_01 Umm... <wait 250>Why did you just come
out of the toilet?
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_14 You're back?<wait 250> I guess there's
no one in the minor league to
really put up a fight, huh?
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_15 It's not like you to slide back down like this! What happened?
<k> stg3_npc_08_02_16 Hey, get in the ring now, or
you'll forfeit the match!
<k> stg3_npc_re_045 Welcome back, Mr. Gonzales!
<wait 250>
You may find my spike
sharper than before!
<k> stg3_npc_re_046 So, you still have some moves
we haven't seen? <wait 250>Cool!
<wait 250>
Bring it! <wait 250>I can't wait!
<k> stg3_npc_re_046_1 Winning consistently is
just so hard...
<k>
<p>
But I'm gonna do it, by gum!
<wait 250>
I'm gonna be champion!!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_01 We need to set it straight
for good!<wait 250> Whose hammer's
strongest, yours or mine?
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_02 How could our hammers lose,
man?<wait 250> I just don't get it...
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_03 Our hammers pound down the
competition, man!<wait 250> POW!<wait 250> POW!
<wait 250>
We'll take you anytime!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_04 Hey, where'd you get the
hammer? <wait 250>You're biting my
style!<wait 250> I'M the hammer guy!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_05 You oughta know, man, this
hammer was forged by my
grandpappy...
<k>
<p>
You really think a new model
like that can stand up to
a vintage heirloom like this?
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_06 My grandpappy used to tell
me great hammer stories...
<wait 250>
World 7-1, that was his 'hood.
<k>
<p>
I'm gonna become champion
to honor his memory, man!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_07 My father decided to quit
Hammer Bros. school and
go to Business Bros. school...
<k>
<p>
How could he do that?
<wait 250>
...I guess it's the responsible
thing to do, but sheesh...
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_08 The day my grandpappy
finished this hammer...
<wait 250>
Sniff...
<k>
<p>
I fought by his side!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_09 My hammer's really been on
fire lately!<wait 250> Seriously, man!
<wait 250>
I just can't lose!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_10 By the way, my mother gave
me this helmet but told me
not to tell my father...
<k>
<p>
Yeah, I left my whole family
behind to come make a name
for myself... <wait 250>They cheer me...
<k>
<p>
I have to make it to the top
for them, man!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_11 My father, the Business Bro,
is in the audience today!
<k>
<p>
He worries about me getting
hurt doing this kind of work...
<k>
<p>
I can't let him see me lose!
<wait 250>
If things are going badly,
knock him on his back, OK?
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_12 You start to lose confidence
when your rank doesn't go
up, know what I mean, man?
<k>
<p>
Hey, but I've come this far,
so I can't stop now!
<k>
<p>
I have to fight for all the
Koopas who helped me get
here!<wait 250> I HAVE to, man!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_13 You know, I'm actually a
little jealous of your
hammer... <wait 250>I mean, your SKILL!
<k>
<p>
But forget skill!<wait 250> I'm gonna
TRY harder than you and
become champ anyway!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_13_01 Whoa!<wait 250> What's the deal, man?
<wait 250>
You drop your hammer in the
can? <wait 250>I HATE doing that!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_14 Hammer-users shouldn't fall
down to the minor league!
<wait 250>
It makes us all look bad, man!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_15 You fell from the championship slot?!
<wait 250>
Then I guess there's plenty of room for me to become champion!
<k> stg3_npc_08_03_16 You forget your hammer in
the toilet?<wait 250> You gotta be
more careful with that thing!
<k> stg3_npc_re_050 I've been waiting, man!
<k>
<p>
You and me have to duke it
out to see whose hammer is
the strongest!
<k> stg3_npc_re_051 No matter what, keep your
eyes on the prize, man!
<wait 250>
That's how you get through!
<k> stg3_npc_re_051_1 Shameful! <wait 250>And you're a
hammerer!<wait 250> Have you no pride
in your hammer, man?
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_01 Let me show you the major-
league difference, my friend!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_02 Not too bad at all, baby!
<wait 250>
It won't be that easy next
time, though! <wait 250>Uh-uh!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_03 There's a big difference
between the major and minor
leagues, baby!<wait 250> Learn it!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_04 You're pretty tough, baby!
<wait 250>
But you're really gonna have
to power up to win here!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_05 I think maybe I could use
a power-up or two as well...
<wait 250>
'cause I ain't going nowhere.
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_06 Y'know, sometimes I see how
well you're doing and I just
lose all will to fight...
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_07 Gonzales, you've come to a
crossroads, baby! <wait 250>Stay sharp
and you'll be fine!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_08 The champ seems pretty
worried about you, baby!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_09 When I watch you fight,
it makes me want to win
more than anything!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_10 You're pretty strong, but
your partners are strong,
too, baby!
<k>
<p>
Maybe I should get new
partners, huh?
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_11 Wow, way to go, baby!
<wait 250>
I gotta block out how much
better you are than me...
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_11_02 So what does it feel like to
stand on top of the world,
baby?<wait 250> It's good, right?
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_12 What's it like knowing you're
so close to the top, huh?
<wait 250>
Don't get a big head, baby!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_13_01 What? <wait 250>Gonzales? <wait 250>Huh?
<wait 250>
Don't you have a match right
now, baby?
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_13 You just came on back?
<wait 250>
Better make sure you don't
fall back down again, baby!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_14 Hey, Champeen...
<wait 250>
What do you think you're doing?
<wait 250>
We look up to you, man!
<k> stg3_npc_08_04_15 Locked in?<wait 250> Yeah, I hate it
when that happens...
<k> stg3_npc_re_055 Welcome back, Gonzales!
<wait 250>
I'm psyched to fight in the
same league with you again!
<k> stg3_npc_re_056 You can only climb so high,
but it seems like you can
fall forever...
<k> stg3_npc_re_056_1 Come on now, pull it together!
<wait 250>
What happened to the
Gonzales I knew, baby?
<k> ep_40 <housou>
Oh, and little %s?
<wait 250>
Yeah, he's fighting solo in
the Glitz Pit!
<k>
<p>
He says he's getting pretty
close to a title match, even!
<wait 250>
Isn't that just ADORABLE?
<k>
<p>
Oh, yeah, he's calling himself
"The Great Gonzales Jr."
in the ring, by the way.
<k>
<p>
It's sorta silly, but kinda
cute, too, don'tcha think?
<k>
<p>
Oh, and...<wait 250> Wait, I have to get
this exactly right or he'll
get like, SO mad at me...
<k>
<p>
He, uh, said that he could
"totally take you in the ring
now, so bring it!"
<k>
<p>
I guess he doesn't change...
<wait 250>
Isn't that too cute?
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is a major-league locker
room.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Everybody here dreams
of reaching the top...
<k>
<p>
You can almost feel the
intensity of their ambition
in the air... <wait 250>It's weird...
<k>
<p>
Speaking of weirdness,
there's ALWAYS someone in
the bathroom. <wait 250>Creepy!
<k>
<p>
Y'know, it's kinda necessary
to have access to a
bathroom now and then...
<k> ガードマン <keyxon>
This guy is Glitz Pit Security.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He has to keep watch on this
particular area.
<k>
<p>
I sure wouldn't want to get
on this guy's bad side.<wait 250> I bet
he's buffer than the fighters.
<k> トゲノコエース <keyxon>
That's the Koopinator.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He definitely looks tough.
<k>
<p>
When we fight against him,
it'd be a good idea to have
a strategy from the get-go.
<k> トゲメット <keyxon>
That guy's Spiky Joe.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's a major-leaguer, so
we'll see him in the ring.
<k>
<p>
He's super-proud of his hard
shell and the pointy spike
on top of it. <wait 250>Whatever.
<k> ハンマーブロス <keyxon>
That's Hamma Jamma.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He must be one of the
strongest major-leaguers.
<k>
<p>
He's got a hammer, like you
do.<wait 300> I think that hammer is
REALLY important to him.
<k> ウラノコ <keyxon>
That's Shellshock.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He seems to be totally on
top of his game.
<k>
<p>
For some reason, though, I
think he's just a big softie.
<wait 300>
Maybe I'm thinking too much...
<k>  

stg3_tou_421_02_kur Shoot!<wait 250> This one won't budge
either!<wait 250> This stinks!
<k> stg3_tou_421_02_nok No good!<wait 250> This one's locked
too!<wait 250> I'm freaking out!
<k> stg3_tou_421_02_win Drat!<wait 250> Locked as well!
<k> stg3_tou_421_02_yos Rats!<wait 250> Locked!<wait 250> They thought
of EVERYTHING!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is another locker room
for major-league competitors.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
It's opposite the other one.
<k>
<p>
Why was there a hidden room
behind the lockers, anyway?
<wait 250>
What would it be used for?
<k>
<p>
Mysteries are totally
everywhere in the Glitz Pit!
<k>  

stg3_tou_63 Well, here we are.<wait 250> This is
your locker room.
<k> stg3_tou_64 You're starting in the minor
league, of course, as you've
just now started your career.
<k>
<p>
If you don't like this dingy
room, I suggest you work your
way up through the ranks.
<k> stg3_tou_65 When you're ready to fight,
you just log on to this
computer terminal here.
<k>
<p>
Mr. Grubba will then decide
who you'll match up against.
<wait 250>
You will have no say in this.
<k>
<p>
Why don't you try it once?
<wait 250>
Walk up to the screen and
log on with <icon PAD_A 0.6 -15 34 0>.
<k>
<p>
Then pick "Reserve a Match."
<k> stg3_tou_66 Mr. Gonzales, I said log on
to the terminal, not talk to
me.<wait 750> It's right there. 
<k> stg3_tou_67 Use the terminal now.
<wait 300>
Don't you understand basic
instructions, Mr. Gonzales?
<k> stg3_tou_68 You needn't know this now,
but your current rank is
20th, the very lowest rank.
<k>
<p>
Now, select "Reserve a
Match."
<k> stg3_tou_69 Well, howdy, Gonzales!
<wait 250>
Ready to get yer fists dirty,
huh? <wait 250>There you go, son!
<k>
<p>
I got a treat fer you: yer
first battle's gonna be
against the Goomba Bros.!
<k>
<p>
Don't you worry 'bout them...
<wait 250>
They'll be a piece of cake!
<wait 250>
Just mop 'em up, OK, son?
<k>
<p>
Hey, we wanna get everyone
fired up, though, so appeal
to the crowd at least once!
<k>
<p>
You got any questions about
detailed rules, just ask the
lovely Ms. Jolene, OK, son?
<k>
<p>
Well, good luck, pard!
<k> stg3_tou_70 OK, your battle is reserved.
<wait 300>
At this point, you just wait
until Security comes for you.
<k>
<p>
Fighting is pretty basic.
<wait 250>
The team that drops the
opponent's HP to 0 first, wins.
<k>
<p>
If you beat an opponent who
ranks above you, your ranking
will go up.
<k>
<p>
Then again, if you lose to a
lower-ranking opponent, your
ranking will go down.
<k>
<p>
Simply winning is not enough.
<wait 250>
When Mr. Grubba sets fight
conditions, follow them.
<k>
<p>
In this case, the condition
is to appeal to the crowd
at least once. <wait 250>Fairly easy.
<k>
<p>
If you satisfy the condition
and win, you can battle a
higher-ranked opponent next.
<k>
<p>
If you can get your rank up
to 11th, you'll get a shot
at the major league.
<k>
<p>
That's about all you need
to know for now.<wait 250> Did you
understand all that? 
<o> stg3_tou_70_yn <select 0 1 0 40>
Yup.
Not exactly... stg3_tou_71 <p>
But it's not complicated...
<wait 250>
You're just another dumb
meathead, aren't you?
<k>
<p>
Oh, I'm too busy for this...
<wait 400>
Well, forget it, I guess.
<wait 250>
Listen carefully this time.
<k> stg3_tou_72 <p>
OK, good. <wait 750>For now, just wait
until Security comes to get
you, Mr. Gonzales.
<k> stg3_tou_73 What is it, Mr. Gonzales?
<wait 300>
I don't date fighters.
<k> stg3_tou_73_01 I'm sorry, Mr. Gonzales, but
you may not leave the room
without a Security escort.
<k> stg3_tou_73_02 Not that it matters right
now, but you rank at the
very bottom:<wait 100> 20th place.
<k> stg3_tou_75 OK, Security's here to escort
you to the ring.
<k>
<p>
Try not to get completely
destroyed out there.
<k> stg3_tou_89 Well, Gonzales,<wait 250> that fight
wasn't a total loss...
<k>
<p>
But listen, son, fighters
gotta play to the crowd!
<wait 300>
You know, pump 'em up more!
<k>
<p>
I'm hopin' you'll gimme more
razzle-dazzle next time, huh?
<wait 300>
We understand each other?
<k>
<p>
Good.<wait 250> I'll be on my way, then.
<wait 300>
Ms. Jolene here'll give you
yer fight money.<wait 250> See ya!
<k> stg3_tou_90 Here's your fight money,
Mr. Gonzales.
<k> stg3_tou_91 <system>

You got <NUM> coin<S>!
<k>
<o> stg3_tou_92 The next fight will not be set
up until you select "Reserve
a Match" on the terminal.
<k>
<p>
You can also check your
current ranking on the
terminal's screen.
<k>
<p>
Feel free to do whatever
you like until your next fight.
<k> stg3_tou_93 You have a nice day,
Mr. Gonzales.
<k> stg3_tou_93_1 Gonzales, that wasn't pretty.
<wait 250>
Gettin' whupped by a buncha
pushovers like that...
<k>
<p>
You won't even make the
majors, let alone become
champ, fightin' like that!
<k>
<p>
Hey, but never give up, you
hear? <wait 400>Now I gotta go, son.
<wait 300>
Jolene's got yer fight money.
<k> stg3_tou_93_2 Here's your fight money,
Mr. Gonzales.
<k> stg3_tou_93_3 <system>

You got <NUM> coin<S>!

<k> stg3_tou_93_4 You have a nice day,
Mr. Gonzales.
<k> stg3_tou_93_5 Yo, Rook!<wait 250> How was your first
fight, dog?
<k> stg3_tou_93_6 I'm King K, man.<wait 250> Just a
bush-league scrub like you.
<k>
<p>
Good meetin' you, man.<wait 250> You
look like a stand-up dude.<wait 250> 
I think I can hang with you.
<k> stg3_tou_93_7 Hey, so, why don't you meet
the gang, huh? <wait 250>This guy
here's Master Crash.
<k> stg3_tou_93_8 Nice to meet you BOMB!
<k>
<p>
Well.<wait 250> Now that we've gotten
to know each other, I will
give you advice BOMB!
<k>
<p>
As Ms. Jolene was saying,
you'd better BOMB obey
Mr. Grubba's conditions.
<k>
<p>
If you clear the conditions
and win, you get to fight
higher-ranked foes BOMB!
<k>
<p>
If you can't clear them,
you BOMB end up battling a
lower-ranked fighter BOMB!
<k>
<p>
You can't climb the BOMB
ranks fighting the bottom
of the barrel BOMB-BOMB!
<k> stg3_tou_93_9 Yeah.<wait 400> My man's got, you know,
some speech issues, but he's
got good advice sometimes.
<k> stg3_tou_93_10 Not just sometimes BOMB!
<wait 250>
Advice is ALWAYS useful
BOMB-BOMB!
<k> stg3_tou_93_11 Riiiight, man, whatever.<wait 100> 
Anyway, this lean machine
over here is Bandy Andy.
<k> stg3_tou_93_12 Heh. <wait 250>Nice to meet you.
<wait 250>
I'm not in here too often, but
if you see me around, say hi.
<k>
<p>
...Oh yeah.<wait 250> If you sleep in the
bed over there, your HP and
FP will fully recover.
<k>
<p>
It's not like the cushy bed
in the champ's room, though:
it doesn't refill Star Power.
<k> stg3_tou_93_13 OK, cool, and this last guy
with the sweet purple kicks
is known as Cleftor.
<k> stg3_tou_93_14 Grack!<wait 250> Cleftor no like make
friend with mustache.
<k> stg3_tou_93_15 Easy there, Cleft-dog!<wait 400> 
Dude ain't the friendliest guy,
but you get used to him.
<k> stg3_tou_93_16 Anyway, that's the core
minor-league crew, man!
<wait 250>
You need something, ask us.
<k>
<p>
Oh, yeah... <wait 100>I almost forgot.
<wait 250>
You and me gotta eventually
square off, so good luck, man.
<k> stg3_tou_re_028 That was a pretty decent
battle, it being your first
comeback fight and all...
<k>
<p>
Still, the crowd didn't really
get very into it, you know?
<wait 250>
Try to pump them up, OK?
<k> stg3_tou_re_029 Here's your fight money,
Mr. Gonzales.
<k> stg3_tou_re_030 <system>

You got <NUM> coin<S>!
<k>
<o> stg3_tou_re_031 You have a nice day,
Mr. Gonzales.
<k> stg3_tou_re_032 Boy, losing like that...
<wait 250>
You've been out of the game
for too long, I guess.
<k>
<p>
You need to choose: either
retire once and for all or
work to reclaim your glory!
<k> stg3_tou_re_033 Here's your fight money,
Mr. Gonzales.
<k> stg3_tou_re_034 <system>

You got <NUM> coin<S>!
<k>
<o> stg3_tou_re_035 You have a nice day,
Mr. Gonzales.
<k> stg3_tou_93_17 Hey, what's crackin', G-man?
<k> stg3_tou_93_18 You just finish beatin' down
some poor fools or what?
<wait 250>
You lookin' good, man.
<k>
<p>
The old King K wouldn't mind
a little bit of your luck,
man. <wait 250>Yeah, that'd be nice.
<k> stg3_tou_93_19 Get in there, you!
<k> stg3_tou_93_20 How many times do I have to
tell you: that room is
absolutely OFF-LIMITS!
<k>
<p>
If you want to remain on
our fight roster, you must
follow the rules.
<k>
<p>
And don't think I haven't
noticed you following me.
<wait 400>
Stop that, too.<wait 250> It's creepy.
<k>
<p>
If you don't obey the rules,
we'll ban you from the Glitz
Pit.<wait 250> Understood?
<k> stg3_tou_93_21 Again, dude?<wait 250> Man, you just
a MAGNET for trouble!
<k> stg3_tou_93_22 Heh heh heh heh heh...
<wait 250>
Sorry, King K.<wait 250> Didn't mean
to bring Queen Nag in here.
<k> stg3_tou_93_23 Aw, don't sweat it, B-money.
<wait 250>
Jolene can take that 'tude
and shove it up her nose.
<k>
<p>
Why you always chasin' that
girl, anyway, man?<wait 250> You got a
little thing for her?
<k> stg3_tou_93_23_01 Shut up, K!
<k>
<p>
...Now...<wait 250> If you folks will pardon
me, I must be off.
<k> stg3_tou_93_24 Man, I heard you just
KNOCKED some blocks off!
<wait 250>
Not bad, Double-G-dog.
<k>
<p>
You're the real deal, man.<wait 250> 
The realest I ever seen.
<wait 250>
Keep bustin' heads!
<k>
<p>
An' if anyone gives you lip,
you just tell 'em King K said
to back it up! <wait 250>Biz-OWWWW!

<k> stg3_tou_93_24_12 Hey, man, this is a brutal
sport, sometimes, you know?
<wait 250>
This stuff happens.
<k> stg3_tou_93_25 Hey, man, check this: <wait 250>I heard
the Hot Dog Stand outside's
gettin' a new menu item.
<k>
<p>
Yeah, sounds like it's some
crazy Hot Dog made with an
egg from a southern island.
<k>
<p>
Some fool was even sayin' the
Hot Dog'll help you win fights!
<wait 300>
You oughta snack out on one!
<k> stg3_tou_93_26 Hey, you hear the latest,
G-dog?
<k>
<p>
My boys said they saw a
STUNNIN' babe havin' a juice
at the Fresh Juice Shop.
<k>
<p>
King K could use a little
shortie in his life, dig? 
<k>
<p>
Check her out for me, man!
<k> stg3_tou_93_27 Listen, man... <wait 250>Keep it under
your hat, but I'm thinkin'
'bout retirin' soon.
<k>
<p>
If I stay any longer...well, my
future might get shorter, dig?
<wait 250>
After next match, I'm gone.
<k>
<p>
It ain't cool, man, that's for
sure, but you know what?
<wait 250>
That's life, Double-G-dog.
<k>
<p>
Listen...<wait 250> You be cool, man.
<wait 250>
Promise me you won't forget
you once knew the King K!
<k> stg3_tou_93_28 It is quite lonely without
King K around BOMB...
<k>
 stg3_tou_93_29 No lonely...<wait 250> Him too weak...<wait 250> 
Now him not here.<wait 250> Sound
normal to Cleftor.
<k> stg3_tou_93_30 You are in BOMB denial,
Cleftor.<wait 250> I saw you weeping in
that locker BOMB-BOMB!
<k> stg3_tou_93_31 Right this way, Sir Swoop.
<wait 250>
This is your dressing room.
<k> stg3_tou_93_32 You're starting in the minor
league, of course, as you've
just now started your career.
<k>
<p>
If you don't like this dingy
room, I suggest you work your
way up through the ranks.
<k> stg3_tou_93_33 When you're ready to fight,
you just log on to this
computer terminal here.
<k>
<p>
Mr. Grubba will then decide
who you'll match up against.
<wait 250>
You will have no say in this.
<k>
<p>
Why don't you try it once?
<wait 250>
Walk up to the screen and
log on with <icon PAD_A 0.6 -15 34 0>.
<k>
<p>
Then pick "Reserve a Match."
<k> stg3_tou_93_34 Use the terminal now.
<wait 300>
Don't you understand basic
instructions, Sir Swoop?
<k> stg3_tou_93_35 Well, howdy, Sir Swoop!
<wait 250>
Ready to get yer wings dirty,
huh? <wait 250>There you go, son!
<k>
<p>
I got a treat fer you: yer
first battle's gonna be
against the Goomba Bros.!
<k>
<p>
Don't you worry 'bout them...
<wait 250>
They'll be a piece of cake!
<wait 250>
Just mop 'em up, OK, son?
<k>
<p>
Hey, we wanna get the crowd
fired up, so do a move where
you do a triple flip and meow!
<k>
<p>
You got any questions about
detailed rules, just ask the
lovely Ms. Jolene, OK, son?
<k>
<p>
Well, good luck, pard!
<k> stg3_tou_93_36 OK, your battle is reserved.

<k> stg3_tou_93_38 Ummm...<wait 400> Hi guys.<wait 400> Yeah...
<wait 250>
My name's Swoop.<wait 250> SIR Swoop,
I mean.<wait 250> Nice to meet you.
<k> stg3_tou_93_38_00 You. <wait 250>Yes, you.<wait 250> Sir Swoop.<wait 250> 
Time for your battle, bub.
<wait 250>
Follow me.
<k> stg3_tou_93_39 OK, Security's here to escort
you to the ring.
<k>
<p>
Try not to get completely
destroyed out there.
<k> stg3_tou_255_01 Hey, tough luck, Mister.
<wait 250>
Hey, maybe walking around
Glitzville will cheer you up!
<k>
<p>
Yeah, eat one of those Hot
Dogs and you'll feel great!
<wait 300>
They might help you win!
<k> stg3_tou_256_kur Boy, Mario...<wait 250> I don't know.
<wait 250>
Those hardheads are serious.
<k>
<p>
But hey!<wait 250> We gotta beat 'em!<wait 250> 
We just GOTTA!<wait 250> Let's keep
challenging 'em!
<k> stg3_tou_256_nok Oooh...<wait 250> Boy, oh boy, Mario.
<wait 250>
How are we supposed to beat
those two monsters?
<k>
<p>
I mean, they just owned us.<wait 250> 
Still, I guess all we can
do is keep challenging them!
<k> stg3_tou_256_win Mario, darling, we must use
our heads!<wait 250> There simply has
to be a way to beat them!
<k>
<p>
Those iron brutes must have
a weakness, so let's keep at
it until we prevail!
<k> stg3_tou_278_kur Heyyy...<wait 250> Check it out!
<wait 250>
Our little eggy friend is
gone.<wait 250> What a bummer!
<k>
<p>
Where do you think the
little guy took off to?
<k> stg3_tou_278_nok Umm...<wait 250> Hey, uh, Mario?
<wait 250>
Did you notice that the
little bouncy egg isn't here?
<k>
<p>
Where do you think it went?
<k> stg3_tou_278_win Oh, mercy me!<wait 250> Mario...
<wait 250>
That adorable little egg
seems to have disappeared.
<k>
<p>
Where could the little fellow
have gotten himself to?
<k> stg3_tou_279 Yo!
<k> stg3_tou_280 Gonzales!
<k>
<p>
Check me out!<wait 250> Thanks to you,
I hatched safe and sound!
<wait 250>
Thanks, man!
<k> stg3_tou_281_kur What?!? <wait 250>You...<wait 100>were in that
cute little eggy-weggy?
<wait 250>
Whoa!<wait 250> That's wild!
<k> stg3_tou_281_nok Ummm...<wait 100>WHAT?!?<wait 250> You hatched
out of that egg?<wait 250> That's nuts...
<wait 250>
So you're a Yoshi, huh?
<k> stg3_tou_281_win Why, you little rapscallion!
<wait 250>
You hatched from that egg?
<wait 250>
Well, aren't you precious! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k> stg3_tou_282 Yeah, but who cares? <wait 250>You
guys wanna be champs, right?
<wait 250>
You want a Crystal Star?
<k>
<p>
I heard all about it while I
was in the egg!<wait 250> Yeah!
<k>
<p>
Anyway, I gotta repay you for
saving me from old Hoggle out
there, so I'll fight for you!
<k>
<p>
I can hold my own!<wait 250> I'll swallow
any opponent whole, honest!
<wait 250>
Just leave it to me!
<k> stg3_tou_283 Huh? <wait 250>My name?
<k>
<p>
Lessee...<wait 250> I just came outta
that egg, so I guess I don't
have a name yet.
<k>
<p>
You seem fired up about it,
so why don't you gimme one?
<wait 250>
Make it cool, OK?
<k> stg3_tou_284 Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm...
<wait 400>
%s, huh?
<k>
<p>
Not too bad, dude. <wait 250>Not too
bad at all. <wait 250>Yeah...
<wait 250>
I like it.
<k>
<p>
OK, Gonzales... <wait 250>Let's get out
there and do some damage!
<k> stg3_tou_286 And Mr. Gonzales...
<wait 250>
Mr. Grubba wishes to see you
in his office.<wait 250> Follow me.
<k> stg3_tou_re_085 Mr. Gonzales,<wait 250> you will battle
in the major league from this
moment on.
<k>
<p>
I haven't the time to explain
everything again.<wait 250> Go to
the major-league locker room.
<k>
<p>
I am very busy, so please...
<wait 250>
Have a nice day.
<k> stg3_tou_297_14_kur Mario!<wait 250> Do you believe what
that is? <wait 250>It's a scientific
report on the Crystal Stars!
<k>
<p>
Someone was researching the
Crystal Stars!<wait 250> And they even
have pictures!
<k> stg3_tou_297_14_nok Wow, Mario!<wait 250> That's a
research document on the
Crystal Stars! <wait 250>Unbelievable!
<k>
<p>
Someone commissioned a
report on the Crystal Stars!<wait 250> 
A report with pictures!
<k> stg3_tou_297_14_win Good gracious!<wait 250> That's a
report investigating the
Crystal Stars!
<k>
<p>
Someone was doing scientific
studies on the Crystal Stars.
<wait 250>
My, it even has pictures!
<k> stg3_tou_297_14_yos Whoa, Gonzales!<wait 250> That's some
kinda scientific paper on the
Crystal Stars!
<k>
<p>
Who'd be investigating those
things besides us?<wait 250> They
even took pictures!
<k> stg3_tou_297_15_kur Y'know, it's REALLY weird
that someone would just
leave this lying around...
<k> stg3_tou_297_15_nok Ummm... <wait 100>Maybe I'm being
paranoid, but it seems odd
that someone would lose this.
<k> stg3_tou_297_15_win I have to wonder about why
someone would leave this
out for us to find...
<k> stg3_tou_297_15_yos Who'd leave something like
this lying around?<wait 250> This just
REEKS of funny business!
<k> stg3_tou_297_16 You again... <wait 400>Mr. Gonzales,
what are you doing in here?
<k> stg3_tou_297_17 This is the minor-league
locker room. <wait 250>Major-league
athletes are forbidden.
<k>
<p>
Even if they weren't, it's

As fighters, our job is to
entertain the crowd BOMB!
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_06 Do you always follow the
conditions BOMB set by the
promoter?
<k>
<p>
If you don't, you'll never
get any BOMB matches with
higher-ranked fighters!
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_07 You should always adjust
your badges and partners
according to your foe BOMB!
<k>
<p>
And do I even really need to
BOMB mention napping to
heal your BOMB HP and FP?
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_08 Teamwork is important BOMB!
<wait 250>
The match is not just for
your personal glory BOMB!
<k>
<p>
If you want to win, you need
to know how BOMB your
partner fights!
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_09 Using items correctly is very
important, too BOMB!
<k>
<p>
You can buy items at the
store outside the Glitz Pit,
so take BOMB a look.
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_10 Following the promoter's
conditions is not easy, but
it's BOMB the only way up!
<k>
<p>
So act like a professional
and you'll be on your way
up in BOMB no time!
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_11 Even if you're not feeling
your best, you must put on
a BOMB-BOMB good show!
<k>
<p>
It's hard when you're not
into it, but that is what
being a BOMB pro is about!
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_12 Developing a reliable style
is good, but don't forget to
try new things BOMB!
<k>
<p>
That's the way you make new
discoveries and really
grow as a BOMB fighter.
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_13 Teamwork is important BOMB!
<wait 250>
The match is not just for
your personal glory BOMB!
<k>
<p>
If you want to win, you need
to know how BOMB your
partner fights!
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_14 You're BOMB back in the
minor league? <wait 250>But you were
our brightest hope BOMB!
<k> stg3_npc_10_02_15 ...<wait 250>What's the matter BOMB?
<wait 250>
Did you leave something
in here BOMB?
<k> stg3_npc_re_065 Gonzales is back BOMB!
<wait 250>
It's an honor to BOMB fight
in the same arena again!
<k> stg3_npc_re_066 Gonzales, why BOMB are you
spinning your wheels here?
<wait 250>
Go blow up some fools BOMB!
<k>
<p>
But watch out BOMB!
<wait 250>
Because I'll be gunning for
you BOMB soon!

<k> stg3_npc_10_03_11 Grack!<wait 250> Mustache got game.
<k> stg3_npc_10_03_12 Grack!<wait 250> Cleftor can't think
of criticism for Mustache.
<k> stg3_npc_10_03_13 Grack!<wait 250> Cleftor admits
Mustache is strong.
<k> stg3_npc_10_03_14 Grack!<wait 250> That not like
Mustache.
<k> stg3_npc_10_03_15 Grack!<wait 250> Is Mustache here to
laugh at Cleftor? <wait 250>GRACK!
<k> stg3_npc_re_070 Grack!<wait 250> Mustache better than
Cleftor when Cleftor was
Mustache's age.
<k> stg3_npc_re_071 Grack!<wait 250> Mustache must take
care of business.
<k>

Mustache is only fighter
Cleftor ever respect.

I've been taking notes every

<k> stg3_npc_10_06_01 Gonzales!<wait 250> Our armored bods
get tougher every day!
<k> stg3_npc_10_06_02 We've perfected our attack

<wait 250>

<wait 250>
Now you see what we're

<k> stg3_npc_10_06_07 Hey, it's Mr. Stinkwad!
<wait 250>

He'll answer to "%s"!
<k> lecture_friends_09_0_1 <system>

Yoshi's Abilities: A Primer
<k> lecture_friends_09_1 <system>
Press <icon PAD_X_ON 0.5 -20 35 -10> to get on and off the
Yoshi!
<k>
<o> lecture_friends_09_1_1 <p>
While riding the Yoshi,
you'll move much faster!
<k>
<o> lecture_friends_10 <p>
Also, while on the Yoshi,
if you press <icon PAD_A 0.6 -20 34 -10>, you'll
float briefly in the air!
<k>
<o> lecture_friends_11 <p>
In battle, you can repeatedly
bounce on enemies using his
Ground Pound move or...
<k>
<p>
You can use Gulp to inhale
enemies whole and spit them
out for massive damage!

This is a minor-league locker
room.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> It's kind of, uh...
<wait 250>
Well, it's pretty disgusting.
<k>
<p>
It's totally different from
the first room they showed.
<wait 250>
The old bait-and-switch...
<k>
<p>
You think they make it
totally gross so fighters
will try harder to advance?
<k> キノシコワ <keyxon>
That's Grubba's manager,
Jolene. <dkey><wait 300></dkey>She strikes me as a
very driven young woman.
<k>
<p>
She's a little cold, though...
<wait 300>
I mean, would it kill her to
be a little nicer sometimes?
<k> ガードマン <keyxon>
This guy is Glitz Pit Security.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He has to keep watch on this
particular area.
<k>
<p>
This guy looks like he could
turn folks into pretzels.<wait 250> I bet
he's buffer than the fighters.
<k> マイケル <keyxon>
That's King K, a fighter.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
His shell's yellow, but I
think he's just a basic Koopa.
<k>
<p>
He seems like a genuinely
good guy, Mario. <wait 250>Plus, I dig
the way he talks!
<k> オクトール <keyxon>
That's Master Crash, the
Bob-omb.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He gives really good
advice most of the time.
<k>
<p>
Isn't it like, so totally nice to
have a mentor who cares
about you?
<k> ガンガン <keyxon>
That's Cleftor.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He might sound a bit gruff...
<k>
<p>
But I think he's actually
nicer than he sounds, y'know?
<wait 300>
Maybe he's just a little shy.
<k> ブロッツ <keyxon>
That's Bandy Andy.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's a competitor in this
league, but he's never here.
<k>
<p>
Maybe he just doesn't care
about being champion...
<k> ポグ <keyxon>
That's Sir Swoop.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He just got on board here.
<wait 300>
Hey, now HE'S the newbie!
<k>
<p>
You definitely notice how
quick the turnaround is when
new people come in...
<k> アイアン <keyxon>
That's the older of the Iron
Adonis Twins.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> You can tell
he's older by his red shoes.
<k>
<p>
I don't think they took their
loss to you too well, Mario.
<wait 300>
I'd be careful around them...
<k> アイアン２ <keyxon>
That's the younger of the
Iron Adonis Twins.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He and his
brother totally hate you.
<k>
<p>
Is it a rule that older
brothers wear red shoes and
younger brothers wear green?

something soon, we're gonna
forfeit that match!

<p>
We gotta get out of here!
<k> stg3_tou_421_01_nok Ummm... <wait 250>I'm pretty sure that
we forfeit if we don't show
up at the match, Mario.
<k>
<p>
We have to figure out a
way to get out of here!
<wait 250>
And quick!
<k> stg3_tou_421_01_win Correct me if I'm wrong,
darling, but won't we forfeit
if we don't show up?
<k>
<p>
There simply MUST be a way
out of this place!

<wait 250>
We're gonna forfeit our

It's quite firmly locked.

<wait 250>
Think this is Twilight Town?
<k> stg4_usu_00_0_win This place has a mysterious
air to it...<wait 250> Might it be...
<wait 250>
Is this Twilight Town?
<k> stg4_usu_00_0_yos Ugh, this place gives me the
creeps.<wait 250> Is this Twilight Town?
<k> stg4_usu_00 Hey...
<k> stg4_usu_01 It's been a long time since
anyone's come from...<wait 250>outside.
<wait 250>
You've come from far away?
<k> stg4_usu_02 Yeah, those clothes of yours...
<wait 250>
I'm pretty sure you guys must
be...<wait 250>adventurers!<wait 250> Right?
<k>
<p>
This is a bad time to arrive.
<wait 350>
Wait, but you're adventurers!
<wait 250>
...Maybe it's the perfect time.
<k> stg4_usu_03_kur Whoa, whoa, whoa, Creepy!
<wait 250>
What the heck do you mean,
a "bad time"?
<k> stg4_usu_03_nok Um...<wait 250> That middle part about
it being a "bad time"...
<wait 250>
What's that mean?
<k> stg4_usu_03_win I beg your pardon? <wait 250>Something
about a "bad time," you say?
<wait 250>
Whatever do you mean?
<k> stg4_usu_03_yos Wait, what?<wait 250> "A bad time"?
<wait 250>
What do you mean by that?
<wait 250>
C'mon! <wait 250>Tell me!
<k> stg4_usu_04 Oh, gee whiz, I dunno...
<wait 250>
It's a scary tale to hear.
<wait 250>
And scary to tell, too.
<k> stg4_usu_05 Oh no!<wait 250> The bell rang again!
<k>
<p>
Oh...<wait 250> This is so awful...
<wait 250>
Who could it be now?
<k> stg4_usu_06 <small>
<scale 0.67>
Oink oink oink!
<wait 600> stg4_usu_07_kur What?!? What?!? What?!?
<wait 250>
Omigosh, WHAT'S going on?!?
<k> stg4_usu_07_nok Whoawhoawhoawhoawhoa!!
<wait 250>
What just happened?
<k> stg4_usu_07_win Goodness, gracious me!
<wait 250>
What might THAT mean?
<k> stg4_usu_07_yos Whoa!<wait 250> That was the craziest
thing I've ever seen! <wait 250>What's
going on in this weirdo town?
<k> stg4_usu_08 Oh, badness...<wait 250> Now poor
Freddy got turned into a
pig... <wait 250>Not good.
<k> stg4_usu_09_kur Hey, who are you?
<k> stg4_usu_09_nok Who are you, sir?
<k> stg4_usu_09_win And who might you be?
<k> stg4_usu_09_yos Who are you, Gramps?
<k> stg4_usu_10 I'm the mayor of this poor
town. <wait 250>Some call me Dour.
<k>
<p>
I'm not exactly the sharpest
fellow, but I do believe
you're adventurers, right?
<k>
<p>
This isn't the place for the
telling of tales, sadly.
<wait 250>
Come.<wait 250> Come to my home.
<k> stg4_usu_11 My traveling friends...
<wait 250>
Welcome to Twilight Town.
<wait 250>
Well, I'd LIKE to welcome you...
<k>
<p>
But "welcoming" people is
generally a good thing, and
it's nothing but bad here.
<k> stg4_usu_12 As you may have guessed...
<wait 250>
our town has been cursed.
<k> stg4_usu_13_kur Cursed?!?
<k> stg4_usu_13_nok Ummm... <wait 250>Cursed?!
<k> stg4_usu_13_win Oh, my! <wait 250>Cursed?!?
<k> stg4_usu_13_yos Whoa! <wait 250>Cursed?!?
<k> stg4_usu_14 Yes, cursed.<wait 250> That is the right
word, right? <wait 250>Yes, of course
it is.<wait 250> You see...
<k>
<p>
Beyond town is a forest, and
in its heart is an ancient
building, the <col c00000ff>Creepy Steeple</col>.
<k>
<p>
The dark creature who lives
there...<wait 250> Its curse ordains that
when the steeple bell rings...
<k>
<p>
One of the Twilighters living
here in the village...
<wait 250>
becomes a pig.
<k> stg4_usu_15 Will my loved ones become
swine?<wait 250> Will I, too, become a
curly-tailed oinker?
<k>
<p>
I'm so worried, I can't sleep
at night.<wait 250> Of course, night and
day are pretty similar here...
<k>
<p>
If this keeps up...<wait 250>well...
<wait 250>
the village will be one giant
pigpen. <wait 250>Which would be bad.
<k>
<p>
Let me give you some advice.
<wait 250>
Leave us! <wait 250>Leave before you,
too, get...<wait 250>piggified!
<k> stg4_usu_16_kur We can't do that, Mr. Mayor.
<wait 250>
We're hunting for something.
<k>
<p>
Have you ever heard of a
Crystal Star? <wait 250>A star-shaped
rock that's all glittery?
<k> stg4_usu_16_nok Uh, see, we can't do that,
Mayor Dour.<wait 250> See, we're looking
for something important.
<k>
<p>
It's called a Crystal Star.
<wait 250>
It's this star-shaped rock
thing. <wait 250>Have you heard of it?
<k> stg4_usu_16_win Sadly, Mr. Mayor, we simply
cannot do that.<wait 250> We must find
something, you see.
<k>
<p>
It's a star-shaped rock that
is called a Crystal Star.
<wait 250>
Do you know of it?
<k> stg4_usu_16_yos Not gonna happen, Gramps.
<wait 250>
We're looking for something
really important.
<k>
<p>
Maybe you've heard of it.
<wait 250>
It's a star-shaped rock called
a Crystal Star.
<k> stg4_usu_17 Uh... <wait 250>I don't know about
any Crystal Star thing...
<wait 250>
but in Creepy Steeple...
<k>
<p>
There's a glittery red stone
shaped like a star...
<k> stg4_usu_18_kur For real?<wait 250> That totally must
be the Crystal Star!
<k> stg4_usu_18_nok Wow, really?!?<wait 250> I bet that's
the Crystal Star!
<k> stg4_usu_18_win You don't say!<wait 250> That surely
must be the Crystal Star!
<k> stg4_usu_18_yos Whoa, are you serious?
<wait 250>
That's gotta be the Crystal
Star!<wait 250> Gotta be!
<k> stg4_usu_19 Uh... <wait 100>You people...
<wait 250>
You aren't thinking of going
to Creepy Steeple, are you?!?
<k>
<p>
<shake>
Brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr...
</shake>
<wait 250>
Unthinkable...
<k> stg4_usu_20 My...
<k>
<p>
My family and friends have
all been turned into pigs.
<wait 250>
That's...<wait 250>not a good thing.
<k>
<p>
This is the village where we
all were born, after all.
<wait 250>
We can't just leave.
<k> stg4_usu_21_kur Hey! <wait 250>You don't think this
pig...<wait 250>is the mayor, do you?
<k>
<p>
What do we do now, huh?
<wait 250>
We can't get his permission
to pass through the gate!
<k> stg4_usu_21_nok Oh, man...<wait 250> You think this pig...
<wait 250>
is Mayor Dour?
<k>
<p>
This is awful!<wait 250> What do we do?
<wait 250>
We need his permission to
get through that gate!
<k> stg4_usu_21_win Oh, mercy me!<wait 250> You don't
suppose this little piggie...
<wait 250>
is that poor mayor?
<k>
<p>
Whatever shall we do now?
<wait 250>
We shan't be getting his
permission to pass the gate!
<k> stg4_usu_21_yos Whoa!<wait 250> This ain't good!
<wait 250>
Don't you think this pig...
<wait 250>
is the mayor!
<k>
<p>
What're we gonna do now?
<wait 250>
We needed that dude's OK
to pass through the gate!
<k> stg4_usu_22 <small>
<scale 0.67>
Oinkie oinkie!
<wait 600> stg4_usu_23 Oh, thank you, thank you!
<wait 250>
We owe you so much, Mario!
<k>
<p>
Please take this as a token
of our thanks.<wait 250> Eat up!
<k> stg4_usu_24 Now, who might you be?
<wait 250>
I don't remember inviting
any shadows to my house...
<k>
<p>
Sorry, but Mario is visiting
today!<wait 250> If you don't need
anything, please leave.
<k> stg4_usu_25 You, huh?<wait 250> You know how
there aren't many shadows
at twilight?<wait 250> Take a hint...
<k> stg4_usu_25_01 Hey!<wait 250> Ha!<wait 250> Whoa!<wait 250> Hee!<wait 250> Wa!
<wait 250>
Look at me! <wait 250>Look at me!
<wait 250>
It's-a me, Mario!
<k>
<p>
Wahahahahahahahahahaha!
<k> stg4_usu_25_02 Boy, Mario, you sure got
chatty all of a sudden...
<wait 250>
I mean, you, like, NEVER talk.
<k>
<p>
Oh well, I guess it's not too
totally weird or anything...
<k> stg4_usu_25_03 Um, Mario...<wait 250> You seem kind
of different.
<k>
<p>
I mean, you're sort of like
the life of the party now,
so I guess that's cool...
<k> stg4_usu_25_04 My, my, my, Mario!
<wait 250>
You're rather dramatic of
late, aren't you?
<k>
<p>
To be honest, dear, I rather
enjoyed your quiet dignity
and strength of character...
<k>
 stg4_usu_25_05 Uh...<wait 250> Gonzales, what's up with
you lately?<wait 250> You're kind of
freaking me out...
<k>
<p>
I mean...<wait 250> I'm all for acting like
a complete loon, but it's not
exactly in your character...
<k> stg4_usu_29 <small>

Oinkity oinkity!
<wait 600> stg4_usu_30 Uh, what?<wait 250> A guy with a red
cap and some blue overalls?
<wait 250>
That sounds familiar...
<k>
<p>
C'mon, brain!<wait 250> Oh, yeah!<wait 250> That's
Mario!<wait 250> He's this adventurer
who saved our village.
<k>
<p>
Are you an adventurer, too?
<wait 250>
...I like adventures...
<k> stg4_usu_31 You know, I always used to
love pork chops, but now I
think about the poor pig...
<k>
<p>
Hmmm...<wait 250> Hey!<wait 250> You don't think
maybe I was a pig in a past
life, do you? <wait 250>What a concept!
<k> stg4_usu_31_1 Ah...<wait 250> You, uh...<wait 250> You...

<k> stg4_usu_32 Living in this dark place...
It's so depressing...
<wait 250>
You know...
<k>
<p>
I don't really care if I turn
into a pig or not...
<k> stg4_usu_33 Oink!<wait 250> Oink oink?<wait 250> Oink.
<k>
<p>
I'm practicing for pig-time.
<wait 250>
If I go to the swine side, I'm
going to be more positive.
<k>
<p>
There's no more pig curse?
<wait 250>
You're kidding...<wait 250> Could you...
<wait 250>
give me some time alone?
<k> stg4_usu_34 You're a real hero, huh?
<wait 250>
That's great for you...
<k>
<p>
You really shine out in a
dark place like this...
<wait 250>
How depressing...
<k> stg4_usu_34_1 Good day...<wait 250> I mean, uh...
<wait 250>
Good dusk, or whatever...

I never know what time it is

that my shadow is faint...

No offense or anything.

Creepy Steeple as our clock.

<k> stg4_usu_110 What?!?<wait 250> You found it?
<k> stg4_usu_111 Oh... <wait 100>Oh, thank you so much...
<wait 250>
Thank goodness...<wait 250> At least I
won't get punished now...
<k> stg4_usu_112 <dynamic 3>OH NOOOOOOOOOOOO!
</dynamic><wait 250>
It's... <wait 250>It's broken!
<k> stg4_usu_113 It must have broken when my
sister dropped it...
<k>
<p>
What'll I do? What'll I do?
<wait 250>
I guess I was just meant to
be punished for life...
<o> stg4_usu_113_select <select 0 -1 0 80>
Hey, don't feel bad!
Here, let me fix it. stg4_usu_114 Thanks...<wait 250> You're very sweet.
<wait 250>
That actually makes me feel
a little better.
<k>
<p>
But what'll I do now?
<wait 250>
My sisters will be back any
minute now...
<k> stg4_usu_115 Oh, don't even bother trying...
<wait 250>
It's really busted.
<k>
<p>
What'll I do now, huh?
<wait 250>
My sisters will be back any
minute now...
<k>
<p>
But I do appreciate your
offer.<wait 250> Thank you.
<k> stg4_usu_116 Hey, wait just a second...
<wait 250>
What's your name, anyway?
<wait 250>
Won't you tell me?
<k> stg4_usu_117 What?<wait 250> I can't hear you...
<k> stg4_usu_118 Your name was stolen?
<wait 250>
I see... <wait 100>Well, I guess that
happens from time to time...
<k>
<p>
...<dynamic 3>Wait, no it doesn't!
</dynamic>
<wait 250>
Your NAME was stolen?
<k>
<p>
That's absolutely crazy!
<k> stg4_usu_119 Gee whiz, you have way
worse problems than I do!
<k>
<p>
And you were worried about
me that whole time...
<wait 250>
That's so...<wait 250>kind...
<k> stg4_usu_120 All right, that's IT!
<k>
<p>
I'm going to help you get
back your name...<wait 250>and your
body! <wait 250>And your friends!
<k> stg4_usu_121 Hey, that's OK!<wait 250> Don't worry
about my problems...
<k>
<p>
I'm not sure I really want to
stay with my sisters anymore,
anyway...
<k>
<p>
And I feel like I need to
repay your earlier kindness.
<wait 250>
It's the right thing to do.
<k> stg4_usu_121_01 So, hmm hmm hmm hmm... <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<wait 250>
Here we go!
<k> stg4_usu_123_viv I guess we need to find out
that ghost's real name first,
huh? <wait 250>That'll be a start.
<k>
<p>
Now how are we going to get
that kind of information...
<k> stg4_usu_124_viv Oh, hey, I have sort of an
idea!<wait 250> Birds pretend to be
innocent with people around...
<k>
<p>
But they're actually really
well informed from all that
flying and eavesdropping.
<k>
<p>
With my power, you can listen
in on their conversations
without them knowing.
<k>
<p>
So, in addition to villagers,
let's also try to get some
info from the local birds.
<k>
<p>
That's the least I could do
for you with my powers!
<k> stg4_usu_125 So I was chatting with
Rotbeak in Mushroom Town on
instant messenger yesterday...
<k>
<p>
And he said he'd just gone
fiber optic on his home
network, you believe that?
<k> stg4_usu_126 Rad.<wait 250> I bet he's downloading
100 meg apps with no
problems on those fat pipes.
<k>
<p>
He's probably surfing that
Feather Club for Crows site
at the speed of light now.
<k> stg4_usu_127 Yeah, it just blows me away,
all this "information age"
hype you hear about.
<k>
<p>
And yet, it's all games and
feather-loss sites that are
driving the technology.
<k> stg4_usu_128 Yeah, but I think tech-bust
survivors can thrive if they
get viable business models...
<k> stg4_usu_129 Funny you should mention
that, actually.
<k>
<p>
I'm thinking of developing
a pay site called "Paper
Mario Weekly"...
<k>
<p>
Yeah, it would provide
real-time updates on Mario's
location and activity.
<k> stg4_usu_130 Hey, that's a good idea!
<k>
<p>
See, there's always a market
if you can meet the users'
needs like that!
<k> stg4_usu_130_1 I'm thinking of starting a
new pay site.
<k>
<p>
It's going to be a real-estate
listings page that I'll call
"Luigi's Mansion."
<k> stg4_usu_130_2 Hey, that sounds good, too!
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250> I think I've heard that
name before. <wait 250>You don't want
rabid lawyers attacking you...
<k> stg4_usu_130_2_1 I'm thinking of starting a
new pay site.
<k>
<p>

<k> stg4_usu_130_2_2 Hey, that sounds good, too!
<k>
<p>
But...<wait 250> I think I've heard that
name before. <wait 250>You don't want
rabid lawyers attacking you...
<k> stg4_usu_131 I've been really depressed
lately, thinking about the
depletion of fossil fuels...
<k> stg4_usu_132 Yeah, tell me about it.
<k>
<p>
We've got to come up with
a renewable energy source
before that happens...
<k> stg4_usu_133 Like wind, or hydroelectric...
<wait 250>
I think solar energy probably
has the greatest potential.
<k> stg4_usu_134 Oh yeah?<wait 250> What's the current
efficiency conversion rate
for solar power? 
<k> stg4_usu_135 Well, it's still down around
10%, but that number's only
going to go up, you know?
<k> stg4_usu_136 I wouldn't consider it feasible
for commercial ventures until
it gets up to 30% or so.
<k>
<p>
And then you've still got the
problem of the sun never
coming up in this village...
<k> stg4_usu_136_1 When will people wake up and
realize that environmental
problems won't just go away?
<k>
 stg4_usu_136_2 No kidding.<wait 250> Air pollution,
global warming, acid rain,
the ozone layer depletion...
<k>
<p>
They didn't start on their
own, and they aren't going to
end on their own, either.
<k> stg4_usu_136_3 Yeah...<wait 250> But I just don't see a
solution at this rate of global
population growth...
<k> stg4_usu_136_3_1 When will people wake up and
realize that environmental
problems won't just go away?
<k>

Yes, actually, there WAS a
General White around here
for a little while...
<k>
<p>
He seemed to be puzzled
about something after his
short stay, and soon left.
<k>
<p>
I'm afraid I don't know where.
<wait 250>
He was mumbling something
or other about a cannon...

Now that the Shadow Queen

Oh, and Beldam also promised

Please.

Let's go ask, Mario.

monster beyond the gate.
<wait 250>
That sounds familiar.

<p>
Well, you know what we have
to do, Mario.<wait 250> Let's go ask
Mayor Dour for permission.
<k> stg4_usu_45_win Mmmm, yes, a nasty monster
beyond the town's borders.
<wait 250>
That does NOT surprise me.

Well, I suppose we must go
ask this mayor for permission.
<k> stg4_usu_45_yos Oh, man, the old monster
beyond the town gate thing?
<wait 250>
Isn't that kinda cliched?

<wait 100>
<k> stg4_usu_54 Sniff...<wait 250> My husband went to

collect herbs...
<k>
<p>
But no husband came home...
<wait 250>
Instead, a pig returned!
<wait 250>
This pig!
<k>
<p>
We got in a fight before
he left, and I had called
him a chauvinist pig...

And now he really is a pig...
<wait 250>
Sniff..<dkey>.

<wait 100>

But he has a sweet side,
too, like cooking my favorite
food on my birthday,<dkey> y'know?
</dkey>
<wait 100>
<p>
<speed 16>
And when shoppers get rude,
my husband escorts them out
in such a manly way,<dkey> y'know?
</dkey>
<wait 100>
<p>
<speed 12>
He's just got so many
wonderful things going for
him,<dkey> y'know?

<wait 100>

I wish he wouldn't dip into
the till for cola money, but
boys will be boys,<dkey> y'know?
</dkey>
<wait 100>
<p>
<speed 7>
And I could really do without
him drying his underwear on
the radiator,<dkey> y'know?
</dkey>
<wait 100>
<p>
<speed 5>
And no matter how often
I tell him, he drinks milk
from the carton,<dkey> y'know?
</dkey>
<wait 100>
<p>
<speed 3>
I don't think it'd be tough
for him to change his socks
once in a while,<dkey> y'know?
</dkey>
<wait 100>
<p>
<speed 2>
But I have my faults too,
<dkey>
y'know?
</dkey>
<wait 100>
<p>
<speed 1>
Like, maybe I shouldn't have
been so hard on him all the
time,<dkey> y'know?
</dkey>
<wait 100>
<p>
<speed 1>
I should've told him how I
felt about him when I could,
<dkey>
y'know?
</dkey>
<wait 100>
<p>
<speed 1>
Oh, how could he leave me
and turn into a pig like
this,<dkey> y'know?

help you, y'know?

<k> stg4_usu_57 What's that?<wait 250> It's locked?

Well, go ahead and open the

<k> stg4_usu_84 Yes, I'm a novelist.<wait 250> It's not all
that easy on the eyes, but
I write by moonlight.

Being a tortured novelist,
writing through the night is
not an unusual thing for me.
<k> stg4_usu_84_1 Yes, I'm a novelist, and I've
actually just recently finished
a new work!

It's a heartwarming love

<p>
Figures...
<k> stg4_usu_84_1_1 Yes, I'm a novelist.<wait 250> My book
has just recently been made

Unfortunately, the idiot
producers reinterpreted my
love story as a horror film...

is absolutely ruining the

And you get this amazing

<wait 250>
A Gold Bar x 3!
<k> usugurashop_30 Greetings, and welcome!
<wait 250>
Wait... <wait 250>Is this your first time
in a shop? <wait 250>EVER?
<k>
<p>
Yeah, you had that first-time
customer look... <wait 250>Let me tell
you about shop points.
<k>
 usugurashop_31 You collect 1 shop point
each time you buy something.
<k>
<p>
Collect enough points and I'll
give you a bonus gift, OK?
<wait 250>
Some are really rare!
<k>
<p>
I put all the bonus-gift details
up on the wall over there, so
take a look.
<k>
<p>
Well, that's my spiel on shop
points.<wait 250> Do you want to hear
all that again?
<o> usugurashop_32 <p>
Well, OK...<wait 250> The customer's
always right, I guess...
<wait 250>
But pay attention this time.
<k> usugurashop_33 <p>
Browse all you want!
<k> irai_20_001 Oh, Mario, you've accepted
my trouble request?
<k>
<p>
Well...<wait 250> It's hard to talk about
in front of the children.
<wait 250>
Can we step outside?
<k> irai_20_002 I need you to help me to
meet someone...<wait 250> His name is
Podley...<wait 250>my former love.
<k>
<p>
We had the same dream: to
be stars of the musical stage.
<k>
<p>
We shared our dreams, and
we shared a wonderful love
for a time.
<k>
<p>
In that cramped little
apartment, we huddled
together, poor but happy.
<k>
<p>
But when I finally got a
part in a Broadshroom play
as the leading lady...
<k>
<p>
Podley left me.
<k>
<p>
He left a quickly scrawled
note that said only this:
<k>
<p>
"My dear, I would only dim
your bright future.<wait 250> Farewell."
<wait 250>
Oh, Podley!<wait 250> WHY?
<k>
<p>
My dream was always to be
with you, not to be a star
that shines alone!
<k>
<p>
I wanted only to shine with
him...<wait 250> Success was nothing
without him.
<k>
<p>
I left the production while
it was in rehearsal.<wait 250> I forgot
about Podley and my dreams.
<k>
<p>
I got married and lived
the life of a housewife,
happy in its quiet comforts...
<k>
<p>
And now...<wait 250> I'm surrounded
by beautiful children.
<k>
<p>
My happiness is so complete
now, I had forgotten about
those days...
<k>
<p>
But then I heard a rumor
that Podley was running a
Chuckola shop in Rogueport!
<k>
<p>
Could you please tell him
that I would like to see
him again?
<k>
<p>
Tell him that Purehearted
Eve has not forgotten her
first love!
<k> irai_20_003 Yes, "Purehearted Eve" was
my stage name...
<k>
<p>
Please meet with Podley and
ask how he feels about me.
<wait 250>
Please, Mario!
<k> irai_20_004 Have you met with Podley?
<wait 250>
Not yet, I see...
<k>
<p>
Please meet with Podley and
ask how he feels about me.
<wait 250>
Please, Mario!
<k> irai_20_005 Have you met with Podley?
<wait 250>
Really...<wait 250> What did he say?
<o> irai_20_006 <select 0 1 0 40>
Tell her the truth.
Make something up, quick! irai_20_007 <p>
So Podley has forgotten
about me...<wait 250> Sniff...
<k>
<p>
That's fine...<wait 250> I guess I was
just feeling nostalgic...
<wait 250>
I'll probably forget about it.
<k>
<p>
You know...<wait 250> I have these little
ones to think of...<wait 250>so I have
plenty to keep my mind busy...
<k> irai_20_008 <p>
Oh, Podley...<wait 250> I knew our love
could never die!
<k>
<p>
Thank you...but no more!
<wait 250>
I'm a different person now.
<wait 250>
Yes, a devoted mother...
<k>
<p>
Just knowing he feels the
same is enough for me to
know joy for all of my days.
<k>
<p>
Thank you so much, Mario.

This is Twilight Town.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
The people here are just as
shadowy as the sky...
<k>
<p>
I wonder if I'd get that way
if I lived here long enough?
<k>
<p>
<scale 0.67><wave>
...Gross.

<k>
<p>
Still, I guess being all
gothed-out is better than
being a pig...
<k> 村人Ｆ <keyxon>
That's a novelist who lives in
Twilight Town.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> I wonder what
kind of novels he writes?
<k>
<p>
I can't believe people
actually read in this town.
<wait 300>
The light would kill my eyes.
<k> 村人Ｇ <keyxon>
That's a local Twilighter.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He's pretty into how
important the moon is here.
<k>
<p>
I gotta admit, it sure is
prominent in this dusk...<wait 250>but
he still may be a werewolf.
<k> 村人Ｈ <keyxon>
That's a local Twilighter.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Are all these people wearing
major eyeliner or what?
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>Oh!</dynamic><wait 300> Maybe it's like, a local
fashion thing!<wait 250> Didn't they get
the memo that goth is out?
<k> 村人Ｉ <keyxon>
That's a local Twilighter.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
This person is still oinking.
<wait 250>
That's...<wait 250>not normal.
<k>
<p>
You think this Twilighter's
still not completely human?
<k> 村人Ｊ <keyxon>
That's a dignified old woman.
<wait 300>
Hey, there was a dignified
pig here earlier, right?
<k>
<p>
<dynamic 3>
I KNEW it!
<k> 店の主人 <keyxon>
That's the Twilight Shop
manager.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> He does most of the
ordering and stocking.
<k>
<p>
And I guess his wife handles
the customers.
<k>
<p>
I thought he looked sick at
first, but that's normal for
these people, I guess.
<k> お店の奥さん <keyxon>
That's the wife of the
Twilight Shop manager.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
They run this place together.
<k>
<p>
She seems like she really
loves her husband, y'know?
<wait 250>
That is SO sweet!
<k>
<p>
She seems kinda indecisive
sometimes, though...
<k> キザ野郎 <keyxon><wave>
Oh, are you KIDDING me?!?
<wait 250>
Not THIS goofy guy again!
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
He follows us EVERYWHERE!
<k>
<p>
And how does he know to
show up before we get where
we're going, anyway?
<k> おばさん <keyxon>
That's Eve.<dkey><wait 400></dkey> It must be hard
work raising all these kids,
so I totally respect her.
<k>

My mom always said that only
hard work brings happiness...

<p>
You think that's true?
<k> 子供Ａ <keyxon>
That's the oldest of three
brothers.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> They're all close in
age, so he's not much older.
<k> 子供Ｂ <keyxon>
That's the middle of three
brothers.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> The middle child is
so "middle child," y'know?
<k>
<p>
............................................
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Does that even make sense?
<k> 子供Ｃ <keyxon>
That's the youngest of three
brothers.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> Hmmm...<wait 300> Not that I
can really tell just by looking.
<k> 門番 <keyxon>
That's the gatekeeper of
Twilight Town.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> There's a guy

I like the sound of this pig's
oink.<wait 300> It's got a nice bass tone.

<p>
Alors! <wait 100>It looks like I am
too late!
<k> irai_28_001 Ah... <wait 100>Now, this is a problem.<wait 400> 
...Eh? <wait 250>What's that you say?<wait 250> 
Ah! <wait 100>You could help me?
<k>
<p>
Excellent! <wait 100>Just marvelous!<wait 100> 
I was just about to give up
on the whole deal.
<k>
<p>
I came to the woods just to
see the Great Tree, but the
thugs up ahead scared me.
<k>
<p>
Contending with goons is not
part of my repertoire, so to
speak, so I've stalled here.
<k>
<p>
Do you suppose you could
give all the goons up ahead
a proper thrashing for me?
<k>
<p>
Well, I'll be waiting here
until you do.<wait 100> Thanks in
advance, chum.
<k> irai_28_002 Ah!<wait 100> Is that you?<wait 250> How's it
look up there? <wait 100>Think you can
show them a thing or two?
<k>
<p>
I've come all this way, so I
can't bear retreating without
seeing the Great Tree.
<k>
<p>
It really would make my day
if you could do away with
all the goons up ahead.
<k>
<p>
Thanks in advance, chum.
<k> irai_28_003 Done already, eh?<wait 250> Marvelous!
<wait 100>
I can finally see the Great
Tree! <wait 100>I'm in your debt, sir!
<k>
<p>
It isn't much, but I hope this
will do you for your troubles.<wait 250> 
It's my change from lunch...
<k> irai_28_005 Perhaps I'll see you up ahead.

Kind of a dreamily pretty

It'd be nicer if it weren't
crawling with enemies...
<wait 300>
But, whatcha gonna do?
<k> マジョリン <keyxon>
This shady woman is certainly
selfish and mean!<wait 250> I mean,
what a total meanie!
<k>
<p>
You see how cruel she is to
her own sister?<wait 300> I wonder
what went on between them...
<k> マリリン <keyxon>
I guess that's the middle
sister.<wait 300> She seems like the
strong, silent type to me.

<p>
Hmm...<wait 300> I can't get a good read
on this girl at all...
<k> ビビアン <keyxon>
This is the youngest sister of
the three. <wait 250>The oldest one
REALLY picks on her, huh?
<k>
<p>
I don't know whose picture

you think she really lost it?

That's that totally gross
guy, Dupree!<dkey><wait 300></dkey> What the heck
is THAT guy doing here?
<k>
<p>
Omigosh!<wait 250> You don't think he
followed us here 'cause he's
infatuated with me, do you?
<k>
<p>
<wait 250>
...No?<wait 300> Oh, what, like it's not
even possible?!? <wait 250>That's kinda
insulting, Mario!
<k> ファビオ <keyxon>
That's Doe T., the Toad who
asked us for help.
<k>
<p>
He came all this way to see
the Great Tree for himself.
<k>
<p>
Now, let's clear out all the
enemies here like he asked,
OK, Mario?
<k>  

stg2_win_e02_00 There! <wait 100>Can you see it?
<wait 250>
That big tree...
<k> stg2_win_e02_01 That's what I was telling
you about. <wait 250>That's where we
Punies live. <wait 250>That's home.
<k>
<p>
Uh, of course, it's not just
us in the tree.<wait 100> Lots of
Jabbies and Piders, too.
<k>
<p>
Well, anyway, Mario...
<wait 250>
Follow me!
<k> stg2_win_e04_01 If we head straight in this
direction, we'll see Flurrie's
place in no time.
<k> stg2_mri_00_kur Hey, you hear that?
<wait 250>
Someone's mailing you!
<k> stg2_mri_00_nok Uh-oh!<wait 100> Ohhhh, man!
<wait 250>
Incoming mail!
<k> stg2_mri_00_win Oh, mercy me!
<wait 250>
Sounds like some mail!
<k> stg2_mri_01 <housou>
Dear Mario,
I'm sure you're very
concerned about me...
<k>
<p>
But please know I'm fine!
I'm actually more
worried about you.
<k>
<p>
The fiends who kidnapped
me are searching desperately
for the Crystal Stars.
<k>
<p>
I'll try to learn what I can
about them. I'll e-mail again
if I uncover anything, OK?
<k>
<p>
You must know I miss you.
Lately I've dreamt about
our days back in the castle. 
<k>
<p>
I hope we'll spend carefree
days there again soon.
            -Princess Peach-
<k> stg2_mri_02_kur Aw, isn't that sweet, Mario?
<k> stg2_mri_02_nok Pretty nice, huh, Mario?
<k> stg2_mri_02_win Isn't that precious, Mario?
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
You see that big tree over
there?<wait 300> It's REALLY big...
<k>
<p>
It's kind of otherworldly,
actually. <wait 250>Wild...
<k>  

msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
If we wanna get over to that
ledge on the right, I think we
gotta fly in Plane Mode.
<k>
<p>
Oh, hey, and Mario...
<wait 300>
Can you see that tunnel-like
opening in the ledge wall?
<k>  

stg2_win_e04_00_01 Ahhh! <wait 100>These woods are the
most wonderful in all the
world. <wait 250>Yes, indeed!

<k> stg2_win_e04_02 Look! <wait 250>There, in the distance!
<wait 250>
That's what I was telling you
about.<wait 100> Flurrie's place.
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
This is the outer part of
the Boggly Woods.<dkey><wait 300></dkey> The flowers
are almost like a carpet!
<k>
<p>
Hey, and isn't it totally rare
to find a white-leaved tree?
<wait 250>
What kind of tree is that?
<k>  

stg2_win_e04_00_02 This place is so different
from the bright flashbulbs
of the world I'm used to...
<k>
<p>
Such peace...<wait 100> This negative
image of the real world
soothes my body and soul.
<k>
<p>
But what's even better...
<wait 250>
is that I, Madame Flurrie,
grow ever more lovely here!
<k>
<p>
Plus, those squishy, adorable
little Punies that live in
that tree are SO nice to me!
<k> stg2_win_e04_00_03 But...<wait 100>I suppose if I stay here
too long, I'll begin to crave
hustle and bustle before long!
<k>
<p>
Oh! <wait 100>Oh, my!<wait 100> It's happening
even as I speak!<wait 100> Already I
feel the need for drama! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k>
<p>
That moment of exhilaration
when the spotlight shines
down on the stage...<wait 100>on me!
<k>

Surely I was born to be...<wait 250> 
an actress for the ages! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k> stg2_win_e04_03 <system>

It won't budge.
<k> stg2_win_e04_04_kur Call me crazy, but I think
this place is totally deserted.
<wait 250>
Should we go back or what?
<k> stg2_win_e04_04_nok Hey, I don't think anyone's
home. <wait 100>It's too quiet...
<wait 250>
Maybe we should take off.
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_00 ...Uh...<wait 250> Excuse me!
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_01 Ummm... <wait 100>Maybe she isn't here.
<wait 500>
I wonder if she went for a
walk in the woods.
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_02 Madame Flurrie! <wait 250>Hellooooo?
<wait 250>
If you're here, say something!
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_03 Eeeeek!
<k>
<p>
No! <wait 250>Out of the question!
<wait 250>
You mustn't come in here! <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0>

<wait 250>
Are you there? <wait 100>Is that you?
<wait 250>
...What are you doing?
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_05 Oh! <wait 100>Wait a moment...
<wait 250>
Those darling, squishy little
footsteps...<wait 100> Is that you, Punio?
<k>
<p>
Oh, it's been an AGE since I
saw you last!<wait 250> You poor dear!<wait 100> 
Is there something you need?
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_06 Uh, well, the thing is...
<wait 250>
We have a problem that only
you can help us with, ma'am.
<k>
<p>
The Great Tree's entry hole
is blocked.<wait 250> There's this stupid
door we can't seem to open.
<k>
<p>
My Puni friends are inside, so
they're in a pickle, and Mario
needs these Crystal Stars...
<k>
<p>
It's a train wreck, really.<wait 100> 
If you can't find the secret
entrance for us, we're done.
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_07 Oh... <wait 250>Is that all, dearie?
<wait 250>
You came all the way here
just for that?
<k>
<p>
My adorable little Punio...<wait 100> 
You know I would do anything
in my power to help you.
<k>
<p>
However, lamentably...
<wait 250>
I'm in a bit of a bind myself.<wait 250> 
I just cannot come out.
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_08_kur Wow, what's the matter?
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_08_nok Gee... <wait 100>Is something wrong?
<k> stg2_win_e05_00_09 It's somewhat embarrassing...<wait 100> 
but I never go out without
my favorite necklace.
<k>
<p>
I just can't find the blessed
thing!<wait 250> I suspect I dropped it
on my daily constitutional.
<k>
<p>
I'd be simply SCANDALIZED if
anyone saw me without it, so
I shan't be going out.
<k>
<p>
I absolutely MUST have that
necklace to highlight my
beauty, and that's that!
<k>  stg2_win_e05_00_10_kur Oh, I TOTALLY know how you
feel! <wait 250>When I go out, I am all
about the accessories!

<k>
<p>
You! <wait 100>Whoever just spoke!<wait 100> 
Do you have some clue as to
my necklace's whereabouts?
<k>
<p>
If you do, you must help me!
<wait 250>
Please!<wait 100> Be a dear!<wait 100> Find it
and bring it back to me!
<k>

If you could, then I'd be
delighted to help my squishy

Flurrie joined your party!
<k> gor_02_aed_win_04 I wonder what kind of drama
awaits us this time!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
What a totally nice house!
<wait 300>
Super coordination between
the red walls and furniture.
<k>
<p>
I'm so jealous it's not even
funny. I have like, NO sense
of interior decoration.
<k>  

stg2_win_e04_00_04 It's settled, then. <wait 250>I shall
rise again!<wait 250> But...<wait 100>before I
make my stage comeback...
<k>
<p>
I simply must whip my body
and mind into shape. <icon HM 0.6 -20 31 0> 
<k>
<p>
I'll just have to put on
some makeup and make my
beauty even more beautiful.
<k>
<p>
Wait a moment...
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
Ooh, AND a canopy bed!
<wait 300>
I'm sooo jealous! <wait 250>Argh!
<wait 300>
I'd DIE to have one!
<k>
<p>
And all the furniture here
is so stylish! <wait 250>It's like,
TEARING ME APART!
<k>
<p>
Interior decoration is all
about balance, and this...
<wait 250>
place...<wait 250>has...<wait 250>got it!
<k>  

stg2_win_e01_00_00_kur These are the Boggly Woods...
<wait 250>
They sure look...<wait 100>boggling.<wait 250> 
Ooh!<wait 100> I've got butterflies!
<k> stg2_win_e01_00_00_nok So, the Boggly Woods, huh?
<wait 250>
Looks mysterious, all right.<wait 100> 
What'll we run into next?
<k> stg2_win_e00_00 Um, OK, just a bit further
and we should be able to
see the Great Tree.
<k>
<p>
The elder and her friends
are waiting for us there...<wait 100> 
Oh, and my little sister, too!
<k>
<p>
Come on, let's go!
<k> msg_kuri_map <keyxon>
These are the Boggly Woods.
<dkey><wait 300></dkey>
Pretty surreal, huh? <wait 250>Looks
like it's out of a picture book.
<k>
<p>
It's pretty...<wait 250>but in an eerie
sort of way, y'know?
